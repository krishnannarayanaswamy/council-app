Development Applications

Estimated Development CostOn 4 March 2024, the NSW Government introduced a simplified and consistent approach to calculating development cost. Key features of the new approach include:a new single definition for estimated development cost (EDC) that can be used for different planning purposesguidance on who should provide cost estimatesguidance on how to calculate development costs using EDC,a standard form of quantity surveyor report for development over $3 million, and standards and guidance provided by the Australian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (AIQS).All development applications submitted on the NSW Planning Portal from 4 March 2024 must prepare an EDC in accordance with Section 6 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2021 and Planning Circular PS 24-002.Council has prepared an Estimated Development Cost form for small-scale development with an estimated development cost up to $3,000,000 which is available on Council’s website and should be submitted with all Development Applications for development with a cost of $3,000,000 or less.An Estimated Development Cost Report / Quantity Surveyors Report must be submitted with all applications as follows:Development with an estimated cost up to $100,000 - Estimated Development Cost should be estimated by the applicant or a suitably qualified person*Development with an estimated cost up to $3,000,000 - Estimated Development Cost  should be estimated by a suitably qualified person*Development with an estimated cost of $3,000,001 or greater - a Quantity Surveyors Report or Cost Summary Report completed by a qualified Quantity Surveyor who is a member of a relevant professional body* A suitably qualified person is a builder who is licensed to undertake the proposed works, a registered architect, a qualified and accredited building designer, a quantity surveyor or a person who is licensed and has the relevant qualifications and proven experience in costing of development works at least to a similar scale and type as is proposed.




Do I need Development Consent?


In general, there are three classifications of development which determines whether development consent for your works is required or not:Exempt Development – Some minor development, called exempt development, does not require consent. Minor works such as a small deck, fencing or kitchen renovations may fit this category subject to compliance with all relevant criteria specified within State Environmental Planning Policy (Exempt and Complying Development Codes) 2008. Find out more about exempt development here.Complying Development – Building a new house extension, adding a pool, or granny flat may be eligible for a fast approval from Council or an accredited certifier.  A simplified and expeditious approval process can be followed for these types of works where they meet standards specified for a complying development certificate within State Environmental Planning Policy (Exempt and Complying Development Codes) 2008.Development Application (DA) - If your development is not classified as exempt or complying development, then a development application is required to be submitted to Council for approval.



How to lodge a Development Application and other planning related applications


All Development Applications and other planning related applications must be lodged with Hornsby Shire Council electronically via the NSW Planning Portal. This is an initiative of the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment, and they have established the Portal for lodgement of applications.The NSW Planning Portal allows for a more convenient and environmentally friendly process for the lodgement of your application, allowing you to lodge online — anywhere, anytime.

Guide to the Development Assessment Process


Steps to take prior to Lodgement of a DAYour Guide to the Development Application Process – Small Housing DevelopmentsReview of the Hornsby DCP and LEP page and General Planning Enquiries – Understanding the planning controls that apply to your property, the type of development you can undertake and how to address any non-compliances, is fundamental in determining the likelihood of an approval. You can obtain the planning controls that apply to your property on our website and discuss any implications which arise with Council’s the Duty Town Planner or by consulting with your architect, building consultant or town planner.Consider one of Council's Planning Advice Services | Written Planning Advice | Pre lodgement Page to discuss specific and or complex planning, environmental or design issues and find out how to address any non-compliances with the planning controls.It is strongly recommended that a Pre lodgement Application be made for complex planning matters or development in heritage conservation areas, development with heritage items, and development on environmentally sensitive land.Read Council's Development Application Submission Guideline. The Lodgement Requirements are the primary tool for Council staff to determine whether your application can be accepted into the system to proceed to notification, referral, assessment and ultimately determination.



DA Fee Quotation


The application fee is a proportion of the development value. It covers Council costs, including notifying the community of your development and the assessment process. Please note that in most cases a Section 7.11 or 7.12 contribution fee will also be applicable after the development application is approved.To find out the fee for your Development Application phone Council’s Customer Service on 98476666 and quote the development value.Council’s fees and charges.



What happens after lodgement of a DA?


Initial reviewAn initial review of your application will be undertaken to make sure the application is complete. If the development does not comply and/or it lacks important information, Council will raise any issues or additional information required with the Applicant through the NSW Planning Portal.Notification/advertisement & SubmissionsOnce your application is formally accepted by Council, it will be placed on public exhibition for generally 14 days and can extend to 30 days, depending on the development proposed. Surrounding residents will be notified in accordance with Council's Community Engagement Plan and will be provided to opportunity to make a submission about the proposed development. Application's on exhibition are viewable through Application Enquiry. Note: If an application is amended before a determination is made, the changes may require re-notification and be subject to a re-notification fee.ReferralThe majority of development applications will require input from specialists within Council, e.g. Tree officer, Building Surveyor, Development Engineer or Environmental Health Officer. If the application is classified as Integrated Development, or involves land associated with a public authority, the application may be forwarded through the NSW Planning Portal to the relevant public authority for comment. The assessment officer will take comments received from referral bodies into consideration when assessing the development applicationAssessmentOnce the notification period has finished, the assessment officer will commence assessing the development application. The officer will review all plans and supporting documentation, conduct a site inspection, review any submissions made, consider statutory requirements and compliance with relevant planning controls, and complete an assessment report.DeterminationThe assessment officer will put forward a recommendation to management or the application may be determined by a Planning Panel, depending on its size, complexity, number of submissions received.OutcomeThe applicant will receive electronic confirmation of the outcome of the application.



How long does it take for a Development Application to be determined by Council?


Council receives and determines over 1000 Development Applications per year as well as numerous related applications such as Subdivision Works Certificates, Construction Certificates and Subdivision Certificates. There may be times when Council’s resources are stretched resulting in minor delays to processing your application.For Development Applications, such as alterations and additions to dwellings, our target processing time is 60 days (excluding stop the clock, where additional information has been requested).More complex Development Applications, or applications that attract a high level of community interest, generally take longer to assess and they may need to be determined by the Hornsby Local Planning Panel or the Sydney North Planning Panel. The target for reporting to these Panels is 180 days.Council’s median processing time for the assessment of Development Applications for the financial year 2021/2022 was 46 days.To assist Council in determining your application more quickly please ensure your Development Application is complete, containing all of the required information before submitting through the ePlanning Portal. Information required to be submitted with a Development Application can be found by reviewing the Development Application Submission Guide.



Online concurrence and referrals


From January 2020, Council will raise requests for development applications requiring a concurrence and/or referral to the relevant agency through the NSW Planning Portal. If a payment is required, the applicant will be notified via email and the application will not progress until it is paid. For referrals not requiring payment will automatically be forwarded to the agency by Council.Certain development applications require approval (such as a permit or license) from a NSW Government agency, before a determination can be made by Council, these are called integrated development. Integrated development applications require an approval listed in Section 4.46 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979. For example, this may include an aquaculture permit, mining lease, pollution licence, Aboriginal heritage impact permit. For Council to process an integrated development application, an integrated development fee is payable, in addition to a fee payable to the relevant NSW Government agency through the Planning Portal, as outlined above.The Online Payments for Concurrence and Referrals guide (NSW Government) will assist you in paying the fee through the NSW Planning Portal.



Before you start work


Before you start any work, make sure you seek advice and approvals from Council or a planning professional. Protect yourself, your project and your community by following the guidance you are given to avoid unnecessary financial and legal consequences.Once development consent is granted, there are some more steps you must take before you can start to build:Obtain a construction certificate - In most cases, a construction certificate is required and can be obtained through Council or an accredited certifier (private certifier). Fees apply at this stage.Appoint a principal certifier (PC) - The certifier will conduct critical stage inspections and provide an occupation certificate once your project is completed. For further information refer to the Appointment of a Principal Certifier page.Notify Council via the NSW Planning Portal at least two (2) days prior to the intention to commence works.For further information refer to the Appointment of a Principal Certifier page.

Compliance

Hornsby Shire Council has strict compliance policies that businesses must adhere to to ensure the safety and wellbeing of workers and the community.






            Hornsby Shire Council aims to maintain, protect and promote improvements in public health for the safety and wellbeing of the community.
        

Public Health





            Building owners are responsible for the maintenance of essential fire safety services installed in their building. Council has a statutory duty in pursuing the fulfilment of legislative requirements governing fire safety.
        

Fire Safety





            Council is responsible for signs and banners throughout the Shire and can investigate unauthorised signage.
        

Signs and Banners





            Awnings over public land can cause a significant hazard, including fatalities, and their safety is the responsibility of the building's owner.
        

Awnings over Public Land





            All boarding houses must be registered with NSW Fair Trading and inspected by Council.
        

Boarding Houses





            There are a number of residential and rural zones in Hornsby Shire where it is possible to establish a business in your home.
        

Home Business





            Outdoor Dining helps to create a more vibrant and cosmopolitan atmosphere in the commercial centres of Hornsby Shire.
        

Outdoor Dining





            Underground petroleum storage systems (UPSS) can leak and contaminate surrounding land and groundwater, creating risks to human health and the environment.
        

Underground Petroleum Storage Systems (UPSS) and Vapour Recovery (VR)





            Civil enforcement is action taken in Court to remedy or restrain a breach of an Act.

Platypus in Hornsby Shire




Using Hornsby Platypus eDNA as a Healthy Waterways CatalystIIn August 2022, the first ever confirmed sighting was made of a platypus within the rural catchment of Colah Creek. Prior to this, platypus were not known to inhabit any waterway within Hornsby Shire, and it was assumed that they were locally extinct. This sighting inspired the citizen science pilot project "Using Hornsby Platypus eDNA as a Healthy Waterways Catalyst" (now completed), which laid the foundation for successfully securing social cohesion grant funding for the Community, Creeks & Critters - Using eDNA Technology to Connect People, Place and Science citizen science project.




Project Summary

In partnership with three local community groups (Streamwatch, Still Creek Catchment Landcare & Friends of Berowra Valley), Council was successful in receiving $10,000 for a Sydney Water ‘Healthy Waterways’ Community Grant for the project “Using Hornsby Platypus eDNA as a Healthy Waterways Catalyst”. These Community Grants are extremely popular, and this was one of only seven grants allocated for 2022.The project aimed to gain a better understanding of platypus distribution within Hornsby’s rural creeklines, improve riparian platypus habitat, and build community knowledge for improved environmental awareness and outcomes in the catchment. Our project idea was inspired by the platypus eDNA research and community education being undertaken by Cattai Hills Environment Network (CHEN) within The Hills Shire.Most of the funding was used to undertake environmental DNA (eDNA) testing – an innovative, non-invasive sampling technique that analyses a small water sample for traces of DNA left by fauna that use the waterbody – to establish if platypus are living within rural creek catchments of Hornsby Shire.



Project Outcomes

eDNA training workshop with a platypus research expert2 x eDNA sampling field days on the 17 and 27 November 2022 (30 Citizen Scientists sampling 23 creek locations within the Still Creek, Halls Creek, George Hall Creek, Colah Creek and Glenorie Creek Catchments)Platypus Q&A session and Habitat Planting Day (36 attendees who planted 224 ‘platypus-friendly’ riparian plants along Colah Creek)A letter from the Mayor of Hornsby was sent to rural residents advising them of the project and seeking local knowledge or sightings of platypusA Colah Creek-focused platypus brochure "Introducing your special neighbour" was produced and sent to rural residentsProduced a map highlighting locations of the platypus eDNA creek sampling sitesplatypus@hornsby.nsw.gov.au email address set up to encourage community feedbackA number of articles on the project appeared in local media



Results

Platypus eDNA monitoring was completed at 23 creekline locations on 17 and 27 November 2022. The results of the monitoring were then processed at the Sydney Water laboratories with the unfortunate result of no fragments of platypus DNA being detected.While the analysis by Sydney Water scientists showed no sign of the iconic species, the timing of sampling could have been a contributing factor. Although no platypuses were detected in these samples, it still provides a reminder of the diversity of wildlife that lives downstream from our residential and commercial areas.In hindsight, we now know from our platypus experts that by November most female platypus have gone into their burrows to nest. The eDNA testing method shows when a platypus is present in the last 24 to 48 hours at a given location. Therefore, it does not reveal population numbers nor confirm that there are no platypus present - it could simply mean that there is a very small population present and that they were either holed up in a burrow or at another location during the sampling timeframe. Heavy rainfall in the months preceding sampling could also be a contributing factor for the nil result.The visual sighting of a platypus by Hornsby Shire Council staff on 4 August 2022 means that at least one platypus utilises Colah Creek as habitat. Despite our eDNA monitoring results, the engagement with the community and raising awareness of platypus within the Shire was very beneficial and is a positive step in encouraging the local catchment community to care for the health of their local waterways and the critters that live within it.This pilot eDNA creek sampling project inspired the subsequent Shire-wide metabarcoding eDNA Citizen Science-focused project: “Community, creeks & critters – Using eDNA technology to connect people, place and science” project.Platypus brochure (PDF 1.4MB)Sampling site location map (PDF 4.5MB)Mayors letter to catchment residents – Platypus eDNA project (PDF 82kb)



What is eDNA

eDNA, or environmental DNA, is a cutting-edge technology used for wildlife detection and monitoring. It is a non-invasive sampling technique that is gaining popularity due to its effectiveness and cost-efficiency.All animals release DNA into their surroundings, such as through mucus, faeces, urine, gametes, and skin cells. Scientists can now extract and analyse DNA from water, air, or soil samples to trace the presence of various species. For instance, a water sample can capture evidence of a platypus being in a creek within the past 24-48 hours.How does eDNA work?There are two methods for identifying sources of eDNA:DNA Barcoding: This method targets a specific gene to detect a single species. It was utilised in the Hornsby platypus eDNA pilot project.DNA Metabarcoding: This method identifies all the species present in a sample.






Platypus Facts




Platypi or platypuses?


The plural of "platypus" has long been established in the English-speaking world as "platypuses." This is due to the Greek root of the name ("flat-foot"). The actual Greek plural for "platypus" is "platypodes," but this isn't used in English. "Platypuses" is the accepted plural form because it aligns with the regular pluralization rules for words of Greek origin and is endorsed by authoritative language sources such as the Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster.As for “platypi”? Well, English is an evolving language, and common usage sometimes dictates a word's acceptance. So, using "platypi" may be a fun and quirky informal term, but strictly speaking, it's not considered correct by most authorities on English usage, including major dictionaries and linguistic guides.



Platy-facts


The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) – or duck-billed platypus - is:a unique, venomous, semi-aquatic mammal that lays eggs and uses its super sensory bill – like an electric sixth sense - to hunt prey in murky waterone of very few venomous mammals in the world. The spur on the male’s hind foot is connected to a venom-secreting gland and is likely used in aggressive encounters between rival malesnot considered endangered but the International Union for Conservation of Nature has upgraded their status to 'Near Threatened'protected by legislation in all of Australia's eastern statesthreatened with local extinction in areas where they once thrived due to bush fires, drought, deforestation, predation, and pollution of waterwaysthe animal emblem of NSW and well-known animal symbol of Australiafamous as the mascot for the Sydney 2000 Olympicsalong with the echidna, the only mammals that lay eggs - they also feature on our 5 cent and 20 cent coinsThe name Platypus comes from the Greek word for ‘flat-footed’ – they're very awkward on land, walking on their knuckles to protect the webbing of their feetBaby platypuses are called “platypubs” (and baby echidnas are called “puggles”).



Where do they live?


Platypuses occur in freshwater systems from tropical rainforest lowlands and plateaus of far northern Queensland to cold, high altitudes of Tasmania and the Australian Alps. Elusive by nature, there’s a lack of reliable data about where and in what numbers they occur. Their distribution is unpredictable, as they appear to be absent from some relatively healthy rivers yet have been found in others that are quite degraded.Platypuses make their home in and near freshwater creeks, slow-moving rivers, lakes joined by rivers, and built water storages such as farm dams.They build a simple burrow in a riverbank, just above water level and often among a tangle of tree roots.



Platypus locally - Hornsby Shire?


Hornsby Shire contains many areas that appear to be suitable habit for platypus including the upper reaches of Berowra Creek and Cowan Creek catchments, particularly those areas in rural or undisturbed bushland catchments.The first ever record of a platypus sighting by a European colonist was near the Hawkesbury River in 1797.Platypus were also observed in Epping bushland in the early 1900’s.In 1976, one was observed at Milson Island on the Hawkesbury River just north of Muogamarra Nature Reserve.In 1977, one was observed near Kimmerikong Creek west of Cowan within Muogamarra Nature Reserve itself.In 1982, a platypus was observed on the north side of the Hawkesbury River in Dharug National Park.In 1983, there were two sightings within Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park along Cockle Creek, just South of Bobbin Head; and near the entrance to Cowan Creek on the northern bank.



What do they eat?


The platypus usually lives alone, and numbers are most often limited by the availability of food, mainly in the form of tadpoles,water bugs, shrimp, and swimming beetles. When not foraging they spend their time in their burrows which they build in the banks of creeks, rivers, or ponds.They feed in both slow-moving and rapid parts of creeks and rivers but seem to prefer areas with cobbles and gravel. At times, they use rocky crevices and stream debris as shelters, or they burrow under the roots of vegetation near the waterway. Hence, the ideal habitat for the species includes a river or a creek with earth banks and native vegetation that provides shading of the waterway and cover near the bank.



Threats to Platypus


People hunted the platypus for their fur in the early 1900s, but they're now protected. Platypus populations are believed to have declined or disappeared in many catchments, particularly in urban and agricultural landscapes. Given their dependence on freshwater systems, destruction of creek bank plants, siltation and other waterway pollution are major threats. Water extraction, dams and diversions to water flow have a big impact. Water quality and in-stream habitat (such as submerged roots, branches, and logs) are critical, so degradation of these elements is a threat. Run-off from agriculture (sediments and nutrient load) can degrade platypus habitat. If you catch yabbies, you should know that Opera house-style yabby traps are illegal and have caused many drownings of platypus, native water rat (rakali), and turtles. Please do not use them!Platypus can be killed by being sucked into the unguarded inlets of irrigation pumps or mini-hydroelectric generators. Water extraction or removal can also contribute to reduced water flow in creeklines and cause a reduction in the overall amount of platypus habitat.Natural predators of the platypus include snakes, water rats, goannas, hawks, owls, and eagles, yet these are unlikely to have affected overall platypus numbers. Up until the early twentieth century, they were widely killed by humans for their fur, and introduced predators such as foxes, dogs and cats are presumed to have had a major impact on populations.Platypuses are also vulnerable to the effects of pollution and declining water quality. The misuse of chemicals (such as pesticides, herbicides, surfactants, and fertilizers) near waterways can disrupt the aquatic food chain, greatly reducing the platypus food supply. For the platypus to stay warm while in the water, its fur must remain completely clean and waterproof, and not be fouled by oil or other pollutants. Furthermore, they are not adept at removing objects caught around the head or body and can die after becoming ensnared in litter such as loops of nylon fishing line or even hair tie elastics.Platypus and their food species struggle to survive in areas where native vegetation has been cleared from creeks and riverbanks. Furthermore, due to Hornsby’s ridge top style development, and past poor building site sediment control practices, many of the deeper ponds along our local creeklines have been filled with sediment from urban run-off. The expansive hard surfaces and stormwater systems of our urban areas have created fast-flowing, high-energy surges whenever it rains. Such conditions may not be ideal habitat for platypus nor their prey.



The future


As part of a worrying trend, the platypus has been in decline across much of its traditional range due to river mismanagement, habitat destruction, predation by invasive species, and an increased frequency and severity of droughts and fires due to climate change. The future of this extraordinary monotreme lies in the balance. Platypus are facing a silent extinction and it is vitally important for all of us to take action to protect them and their habitat



How can you help?


Please don't disturb platypus if they live in creeklines on your property or in your local catchment.You can help the platypus living in your area by planting and maintaining locally native riparian-friendly plants along waterways. If you do this, you will protect the creek banks and provide areas for the platypus to live.To prevent platypus and other aquatic wildlife from drowning or otherwise dying after being sucked into water extraction pumps or water-powered generators, a mesh cover or equivalent barrier should be fitted at an appropriate distance around all intake points and checked regularly.Spread the word among friends and acquaintances that Opera House-style yabby traps and homemade equivalents are responsible for drowning many platypuses, Australian water rats (Aboriginal name, Rakali) and freshwater turtles each year. From 30 April 2021 yabby traps (“opera house”) are illegal and no longer permitted in NSW waters.Don't let your dogs and cats wander unsupervised at night - this will help safeguard the welfare of your pets as well as wildlife. Obey local laws which prohibit the presence of unleashed pets in Wildlife Protection Areas. Even during the day, uncontrolled dogs and cats can disrupt the natural behaviour of platypus and other native species occupying such habitats.And remember – whatever goes down the drains of our stormwater system ends up in the local creek – where the platypus are trying to survive.

Rainwater tanks

Finding the right rainwater harvesting system to suit your household needs requires some research. If you get quotes from at least three rainwater tank suppliers, you'll find the right solution for the best price.Using rainwater helps conserve valuable mains drinking water and reduces stormwater run-off which can pollute local creeks and rivers.What can I use my harvested water for?Harvested water from rainwater tanks is recommended for all non-drinking uses such as:Garden wateringToilet flushingLaundry usageReplenishing domestic pools or spasCar washingProtecting homes from bush firesWhat are the typical components of a rainwater harvesting system?Typical components of a rainwater harvesting system include:the roof catchment area and gutters - maximising the roof area flowing to your tank is the best way to maximise your water savings, regardless of your tank sizethe collection system (downpipe, screened leaf diverting rain-head and first-flush water diverter)the rainwater tank itself, andthe supply system (pumps, controllers and filters)What types of tanks are available?Polyethylene or plastic tanks are durable and, because rust isn't an issue, tend to be recommended for people living near the ocean. Other synthetic materials, such as PVC and geotextile, are used for bladder storage.Metal tanks are made from corrugated or flat rolled metal, which may be galvanised or coated. They often come with a plastic inner lining that will increase the life of the tank and protect the water quality.Fibreglass tanks are rust and chemical-resistant and designed to withstand extreme temperatures. They're not the cheapest option, and more suitable for above-ground installation, while all other types can also be installed below ground.Concrete tanks, more often used for agricultural and industrial purposes, won't rust, burn, melt or blow away. They can be bought ready-made, or custom made on-site.The type you choose depends on a number of factors such as budget, space, water demand and whether the tank will be above or below ground.For more information visit the Renew | Tankulator website.What size tank do I need?The capacity you choose will depend on the size and shape of your household and garden. Tanks can be round, squat, slim line or bladders. Squat tanks fit well under a deck, while slim line tanks are good for narrow spaces. An under floor tank or bladder storage system is a good out-of-sight space saver, but is more expensive.The ideal size of the tank depends on the following four factors:How you intend to use your harvested rainwaterSize of your roof catchment areaLocal annual rainfallHow much water your household currently usesOnce you have this information, you can work out how big your tank will need to be to match your requirements. You can determine your household water use by examining your latest water bill.As a general guide:For every 1mm of rain that falls on 1m2 of roof, 1 litre of water is collected. Therefore for a roof that is 100m² (10m x 10m), each 1mm of rainfall will deliver 100 litres of waterAnnual average rainfall in Sydney is 1175mmThe average person in Sydney consumes around 380 litres of water per day. Approximately 12L of this is for drinking and cooking, 38L is for flushing the toilet, 100L is for bath and shower, 15L dishwasher and washing machine, 195L is for gardens and 12L for otherThe Tankulator rainwater tank calculator may help to make the decision process easier.What other accessories will I need?Additional equipment that you will need includes:mosquito proofing of all openings to prevent breedingbackflow prevention devices when your tank is plumbed internallymains water back up system for internally plumbed tanks – so you don’t run out of watersigns for all outlets of the rainwater tank stating that it is rainwaterWill I need to buy a pump?Depending on the location of your tank and whether it is plumbed internally, you may have to install a pump. The size and type of pump you select is something you should discuss with your chosen supplier. Pumps can be noisy so they must be housed in a soundproof enclosure.What is a first-flush water diversion device?A first-flush device prevents the initial 10 to 20 litres of rainwater from flowing into the tank, as this water is more likely to be contaminated with leaves and debris from the roof. A first-flush device is essential to maintain a high standard of water quality from your rainwater tank.Is rainwater safe to drink and to cook with?NSW Health recommends not to drink or to cook with rainwater harvested in most urban areas. They recommend that people use the public mains water supply for drinking and cooking because it is generally treated by means of filtration, disinfection and fluoridation.People who choose to use rainwater for drinking and cooking should be aware of potential risks associated with microbiological and chemical contamination. Rainwater tanks in urban areas can be contaminated with airborne contaminants from heavy traffic, smelters and heavy industry.See also:NSW Health Rainwater Tanks Fact Sheet Australian Drinking Water GuidelinesCan I harvest rainwater from an asbestos roof?Rainwater can be collected from most types of roofs, including asbestos / fibro-cement roofs, providing they have not been painted with lead-based paints or coated with bitumen-based material.Although no longer used in new houses, asbestos may be present in some pre-1970s roofs. Although asbestos fibres are dangerous to health when inhaled in sufficient quantities, the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines state that “the weight of evidence indicates that ingested asbestos is not hazardous to health” and therefore it is not believed that asbestos in drinking water poses a risk.Asbestos is incorporated into some types of pipe used in distribution of public water supplies.Note: Asbestos roofing material should, as far as is practicable, be left undisturbed since fibres can be released into the air by actions such as cutting, grinding or drilling. High-pressure roof cleaning methods should not be used on asbestos roofs. Where the roof catchment area has deteriorated badly, it should be replaced with asbestos-free substitutes.How do I manage and maintain my rainwater harvesting system?Tanks are low maintenance, not ‘no’ maintenance! Rainwater harvesting systems must be designed to minimise health and safety risks and need to be maintained.Dust and debris on the roof of the house can contaminate the water. A first-flush water diversion device should be used and regularly cleaned. Gutters and leaf-screens should also be regularly checked. To prevent mosquitoes from entering the tank, all inlets and outlets to the tank need to be blocked with insect-proof screens.For more detail on managing and using rainwater tanks see the Department of Health publication Guidance on the Use of Rainwater Tanks.Do I need Council approval?Most residential water tanks (up to a maximum capacity of 10,000 litres) are exempt from requiring development consent from Council, however, there are conditions to this as outlined in State Environmental Planning Policy (Exempt and Complying Development Codes) 2008 that need to be met.If your rainwater tank does not meet these planning requirements, development consent may be required prior to tank installation.To identify if your property benefits from exemption circumstances you can use the online Exempt and Complying Development eModule.What are the State Environmental Planning Policy requirements?Rainwater tanks (above ground)Specified developmentThe construction or installation of a rainwater tank above ground is development specified for this code if it is not constructed or installed on land in a foreshore area or in an environmentally sensitive area.Development standards1. The standards specified for that development are that the development must:if it is on land other than land in Zone RU1, RU2, RU3, RU4, RU6, R5, E2, E3 or E4: for an educational establishment—not have a capacity of more than 25,000 L, andin any other case—not have a capacity more than 10,000 L, andbe located at least 450mm from each lot boundary, if the tank has a height of more than 1.8m above ground level (existing), andif it is on land in Zone RU1, RU2, RU3, RU4, RU6, R5, E2, E3 or E4—be located at least 10m from each lot boundary, andbe located behind the building line of any road frontage, andnot rest on the footings of an existing building for support, andnot require cut and fill of more than 1m below or above ground level (existing), andbe fitted with a screened rain head designed to ensure self-cleaning and prevent leaf litter entering into the water tank, andbe fitted with a first-flush device incorporating an automatic resetting valve that causes initial run-off rainwater to bypass the tank, andbe constructed or installed with inlets and outlets designed to prevent mosquitoes breeding in it, andhave its overflow connected to an existing stormwater drainage system that does not discharge to an adjoining property, or cause a nuisance to adjoining owners, andhave a sign affixed to it with a statement to the effect that the water in the tank is rainwater, andif it is constructed or installed on or in a heritage item or a draft heritage item—be located in the rear yard.2. Pumps attached to the development must be housed in an enclosure that is soundproofed.3. If reticulated water is provided to the lot, the development must not be interconnected with any system supplying drinking water to the lot unless it complies with the relevant water authority’s requirements.4. In this clause: educational establishment means a building or place used for education (including teaching) and includes a pre-school, a school, a tertiary institution that provides formal education (such as a university or TAFE establishment) and an art gallery or museum that is not used to sell the items displayed in it (whether or not the building or place is also used for accommodation for staff or students).For more information go to NSW Legislation.State Environmental Planning Policy (Exempt and Complying Development Codes) 2008 - NSW Legislation (Rainwater tanks - above ground).Rainwater tanks (below ground)Specified developmentThe construction or installation of a rainwater tank below ground is development specified for this code if:it is constructed or installed on land in Zone RU1, RU2, RU3, RU4, RU6 or R5, andit is not constructed or installed on land that is identified on an Acid Sulfate Map as being Class 1–5, andit is not constructed or installed on land that is identified as an environmentally sensitive area.Development standards1. The standards specified for that development are that the development must:be fitted with a first-flush device that causes initial run-off rainwater to bypass the tank, andhave a sign affixed to it stating the water in it is rainwater, andbe constructed or installed to prevent mosquitoes breeding in it, andhave its overflow connected to an existing stormwater drainage system that does not discharge to an adjoining property, or cause a nuisance to adjoining owners, andif it is constructed or installed on or in a heritage item or a draft heritage item—be located in the rear yard.2.

            The Bushland Shire has a strong history of community activism, especially around bushland protection, conservation of endangered species and water quality.
        

Citizen Science





            Hornsby Shire Council supports community gardens where local residents can grow herbs, vegetables and fruit. You can make new friends, learn new skills and save money.
        

Community Gardens





            There are a number of introduced species in Hornsby Shire that significantly threaten our native animals and vegetation, with rabbits, foxes and Indian mynas topping the list.
        

Pest and Nuisance Animals





            Hornsby Shire's extensive bushlands are home to over 300 native vertebrate animal species. Council is responsible for ensuring that their habitats are protected.

Public Hazards and Nuisances

We all have to do our part to ensure that we are abiding by rules and regulations that make our community a safe and enjoyable place to live. Find out what you can do to report on any public hazard or issues that you have come across.






            The two main air pollution issues handled by local government are odour complaints and smoke from wood fires.
        

Air Pollution





            It is estimated one in three homes contain asbestos, a dangerous material that should never be handled lightly.
        

Asbestos handling and removal





            Graffiti is best removed as soon as possible. If you come across graffiti on Council property, phone Council’s Graffiti Hotline on 1800 199 282.
        

Graffiti





            llegal dumping costs Council and the community thousands of dollars each year and damages our environment.
        

Illegal Dumping





            Using waste as 'fill' without approval can harm your family’s health, devalue your property and leave you with substantial cleanup costs.
        

Illegal Landfill





            The NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has launched a new system that allows the public to report littering offences from vehicles.
        

Littering from Vehicles





            Council has some power to investigate offensive noise, though it is generally best to try to resolve the problem without involving the authorities.
        

Noise





            Owners and occupiers are responsible for the maintenance of their property, ensuring a safe and healthy environment.
        

Overgrown and Unsightly Land





            Hornsby Shire is surrounded by natural waterways so great care must be taken to avoid water pollution.
        

Water Pollution





            Plants that significantly impact upon the natural environment, the community or the economy should be controlled. Weeds cause significant damage to our unique environment and it is up to all of us to help control them.
        

Weeds





            Abandoned trolleys can obstruct roads or footpaths, become a trip hazard or end up in our waterways.
        

Abandoned Trolleys





            Council officers investigate reports of unattended property including vehicles in public places.
        

Unattended Vehicles





            The Bush fire Hazard Complaint process provides a mechanism for individuals to refer bush fire hazard concerns directly to the NSW Rural Fire Service.
        

Bush Fire Hazard Complaints

Is your roof suited to solar? Free webinar


                 This session will show you the solar and battery calculator (SunSPOT) and how it helps you decide if solar is good for you and your roof.
            















Get Tailored Solar Information for your house‘SunSPoT’ solar calculator is now available to Hornsby Shire residents and businesses, to help you make an informed solar purchasing choice.What will SunSPoT tell you?SunSPoT provides answers to many confusing questions about solar for buyers including:How much money will a solar PV system save me in a year?What are the best areas for solar panels on my building roof?What size system is best?How much energy will it generate?What should I be paying for a solar system?How much more will I save with a battery?What makes SunSPot different to other online solar calculators?Your details are privateUnlike other online solar calculators, SunSPoT does not collect and share your details with solar sales companies. SunSPoT was built specifically to help small energy users (home and business owners).Sophisticated softwareSunSPoT’s clever 3D spatial mapping technology allows it to identify the tilt and orientation of a roof plane, and determine the impact of shading from buildings and trees throughout the year.Tailored resultsThe results are uniquely tailored to your roof, your area and your electricity usage. Using average solar system pricing data provided by Solar Choice, and your personalised electricity billing data and usage info, the calculations provide a reliable benchmark that can be compared with quotes from solar sales companies.If you’re thinking about getting solar, start your search with the free SunSPoT solar potential tool.


Here are a few other things to consider:Solar for my householdSolar power is generated when the sun is shining, so if you can use the power generated on your roof during daylight hours it is FREE. Some households place appliances, such as dishwashers and washing machines, on timers to come on during the day whilst they are at work and the sun is shining.Great InvestmentIn general you can expect an average payback period of 7 years for your solar investment. Of course this may be less depending on your household electricity consumption and system size. The savings however can be enjoyed for up to twenty-five years, which is the lifetime of the panels. There is an upfront discount from the federal government that reduces the purchase price.WarrantiesAs the saying goes ‘you get what you pay for’. It is best not to make your investment decision based on the cheapest price. A quality solar systems warranty is at least twenty-five years on the panels and ten years for an inverter.Council supports the installation of solar across the Shire and currently generates 207 kW of electricity from renewable sources, located at Council facilities such as libraries and parks. Please refer to Council’s Renewable Energy Sites page.

Discover ways to make your home more sustainable. Please find information below on how to cut your energy and water usage.Saving Energy in the Home




Solar on your roof


Solar power systems are now an affordable option for Australian households looking to reduce their power bills and generate their own clean electricity. With the increased range of products and suppliers on the market, being an informed consumer has never been more important. The Clean Energy Council’s Consumer Guide to Buying Household Solar Panels tells you everything you need to know.The SunSPoT solar calculator can help you make an informed solar purchasing choice.The NSW Home Solar Battery Guide will also help you decide if and when a battery is practical for your household.



Save Power Kits and Thermal Cameras at Your Library


Borrow a Save Power Kit or Thermal Camera from your local library. Save Power Kits can help you find out which of your appliances are using the most energy and how you can save money on your power bills. Thermal Cameras can help you locate insulation and draught problems in your home. The Save Power Kits contain a power monitor, infrared thermometer and thermometer to test heating, cooling and refrigeration temperatures. New Thermal Cameras are now available separately for borrowing.



Switch to GreenPower


Help decrease greenhouse gases by purchasing GreenPower products from your energy retailer, who will then buy electricity from renewable energy sources on your behalf.



Get a Smart Energy Meter


Getting a smart energy meter will help you make informed choices about energy efficiency decisions.This means you can size-up the right size solar for your home, and perhaps save money in the process by knowing what is using your energy and when.Here’s some advice from Canstarblue on how to request a meter.There may be a small cost,  or you might be surprised to find out you already have one.You can request existing meter data from your provider and they may have an app too so you can get just in time alerts.



Get value for your money


Energy Made Easy lets you compare all electricity and gas retailers in your area to see if you are on the best energy offer for your needs. You can also learn how to understand your electricity usage and compare it against other households in your area.



Lighting


Turn off unnecessary lights.Make the most out of natural lighting.Replace all light globes with energy efficient ones.Where possible install LED lighting, which last 80 times longer than incandescent globes and will save at least 85 percent of electricity use.Use the lowest wattage globe wherever possible.Keep lights and light fittings clean and free from dust. Dust build-up can reduce light output by up to 50 percent.Avoid down lights. Apart from using more energy, they also contribute to heat loss through the roof.Use timer controls or sensors to switch lights off automatically.Paint walls in light colours to reduce the amount of lighting needed.



Heating and cooling


Seal cracks around windows and doors or use door ‘snakes’.Hang heavyweight, tight-fitting curtains from closed pelmets to reduce heat loss by 30-50 percent.Keep your home cooler in summer by shading north and west facing windows with native vegetation or awnings.Wear warmer clothes.Close off unoccupied rooms.Consider roof, underfloor and wall insulation.Use ceiling fans in high temperatures.Reverse cycle air conditioners are up to four times more energy efficient than other heaters.Use a thermometer to set temperatures for heating and cooling. Ensure it is between 18 to 21 degrees Celsius in Winter and 23 to 26 degrees Celsius in Summer.



Appliances


Turn off electrical appliances (computers, TVs, DVD players) overnight and when not in use.When purchasing new appliances buy a high star rated model to save energy and water. The more stars the more savings! Find out more about energy ratings.If you have time-based billing, use dishwashers, washing machines or dryers during off peak times to save money (after 10pm and before 7am).Wait until you can wash with full loads rather than washing small loads frequently.Dry your washing on the clothes line rather than using a drier as often as possible.Program the computer to have a blank screen when idle as screensavers will not reduce energy use.



Cooking


Use a microwave rather than a conventional oven to cut costs by 70 percent.Try not to open the oven door when cooking.Boil water in an electric kettle instead of on the hotplate.When cooking in a saucepan, use minimal water and keep the lid on to trap heat.Fan-forced ovens cost up to 35 percent less to run than conventional ovens.Cook larger batches of food and freeze for another day.



Refrigerator/Freezer


Set the fridge at five degrees Celsius and the freezer at minus-15 degrees to reduce running costs.Keep the fridge at least five centimetres from the wall to allow the heat to escape and save up to 150kg of greenhouse gases each year.Locate your fridge/freezer out of the sun and away from the oven.Open the doors as little as possible.



Comfortable Homes in Summer and Winter Sustainability Checklist


Get started by using this Comfortable Homes in Summer and Winter sustainability checklist.Sustainability Checklist







Reducing Water UseRainwater tanks store rainwater run-off from your roof and offer an alternative water supply for use in your home and garden. Find out more about Rainwater systems




Your bathroom


Check for leaking taps. One leaking tap can waste up to 2,000 litres a month.Install a water efficient showerhead or fit a flow-restricting valve. Showers can now use as little as 9 litres per minute instead of the old shower heads that used 22 litres per minute.Turn taps off tightly and replace washers when they begin to leak.Take shorter showers by using a timer.Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth and use a plug in the basin when shaving.Turn your single-flush toilet into a dual-flush toilet or install a displacement device in the cistern (tank) of single-flush toilets.Check your toilet for leaks by adding drops of food colouring to the cistern. Don’t flush for one hour and if the colouring shows up in the bowl it’s leaking.Before you go to bed, check your water metre reading then make sure no one uses any water overnight. If the reading is higher in the morning, you have a leak.Install water efficient taps or tap aerators to cut water usage.



Your kitchen


Choose a dishwasher with a 5-star rating for sparkling dishes and a lower water bill.Dishwashers connected to cold water are usually more efficient than those connected to hot water systems.Use a bowl of water to rinse vegetables and other food items instead of running the tap.



Your laundry


Choose washing machines with a water efficiency rating of 4-and-a-half stars or above, which can use up to two-thirds less water than inefficient models.Look for a front-loading washing machine with at least 4-and-a-half stars when you buy a new washing machine.Front-loading washing machines generally require less water than top-loading machines.Adjust the load water level to match the amount you’re washing or only put on full loads.Regularly clean the lint filter on your washing machine.



Your garden


Choose native plants, which require less water.Group plants with similar watering needs together.Adjust your watering patterns to weather conditions and plant needs.Wash your car on the lawn and water the grass at the same time.Use a bucket for washing and rinsing your car, rather than leaving the hose running which can waste 20 litres of water a minute.Use a rake or broom to clean paths and driveways rather than a hose.Install a greywater system - 555kb to reuse your laundry water in the garden.Install a water tank for your garden. Rainwater can be used to water your garden, wash clothes and flush toilets. It can also be used to supplement the mains water supply, as long as you have approval from Sydney Water.



Pools and Spas


The average backyard pool can lose up to 50,000 litres of water a year through evaporation. Installing a cover on pools and spas reduces this water loss.Ask your local nursery for advice on plants to screen the pool or spa and further reduce water loss.Install a shade cloth over the area to reduce evaporation.Consider replacing a sand filter with a cartridge filter, which requires less backwashing.Install an automatic pool cleaner to further reduce the need to backwash.

Renewable Energy

Pursuing our commitment to Net Zero by 2050Council is pursuing both the purchase and generation of 100% renewable energy to actively meet our targets set by the Climate Wise Hornsby Plan.Hornsby Shire to go 100% renewable energyHornsby Shire Council has 100 percent of its electricity needs supplied by three NSW solar farms. The landmark retail electricity agreement will deliver over 214 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year to 25 councils across NSW, including Hornsby Shire Council. Green energy will now power over 300 major council facilities, more than 210,000 streetlights and more than 3000 small sites managed by councils across NSW. Worth approximately $180 million.The 25 councils participating in the agreement collectively represent over three million people, and almost 38 percent of NSW’s population. The agreement commences in 2022 and runs to 2026 with an option to extend to 2030.In an effort to help reach our Greenhouse Gas Emissions target, Hornsby Council has 232.11 kW of solar panel systems and one 15kW wind turbine on Council buildings, libraries, works depot and park facilities.The map below indicates where the renewable technologies are in Hornsby Shire.

Waste FAQs

Below is a list of our most frequently asked questions. If you can't find what you're looking for here phone Council’s Waste Hotline on 13 70 30.




When are my bins collected?


You can find your collection dates using our Find My Collection Dates tool. You can also call Council’s Waste Hotline on 13 70 30



What if my bins are not collected?


If your garbage, recycling or green waste bin hasn’t been collected please leave it out and our collection contractor will come back and collect it today or tomorrow.Please make sure you report any missed bin collections to our Waste Hotline on 13 70 30 to ensure we are aware of the missed service and can advise the Contractor.For more information on why your bin may not have been collected please read My bin was not collected. Why? below



My bin has not been collected. Why?


Is your house the only house in the street where bins have not been collected? If so:You may have put the bin out too late or placed the wrong bin.The bin may be too heavy. Bins must not weigh more than 70kg.The driver may not have seen the bin due to an obstruction.The bin may have been contaminated (see What should I do with my waste?) or overfilled (please ensure the lid closes).Please call Council’s Waste Hotline on 13 70 30 to have your bins collected once you have fixed the problem.Please also note Council will only collect domestic waste and recycling bins it has provided. These have a coloured (red, yellow or bright green) lid and a Hornsby Shire Council logo on the front of the body of the bin.



What happens to our recycling (yellow lid bin)?


The recycling in the yellow lid bin is currently taken to the Visy Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) at Smithfield where it is sorted.Who sorts the recycling?The truck unloads unsorted recycling (paper, plastics, glass, etc) onto conveyor belts and then the sorting process begins. Air jets are used to separate paper, regular magnets are used to pick up steel cans, eddie current magnets are used to repel aluminium into containers, while lasers identify and sort glass into different types and colours. Other materials are sorted by hand, such as items too contaminated for recycling (for instance plastic bags, large pieces of cardboard).Once sorted, the materials are sent to specialist recycling plants.What happens next?Materials are treated and the resources are recovered in a number of different ways:Glass bottles and jarsGlass is stockpiled and transported to a glass beneficiation plant where the glass is scanned for any impurities and carefully sorted to remove items such as pyrex, ceramics, china, bone, oven proof glass and any other products that will not melt down. Once melted down, the sorted glass is mixed with cullet (crushed glass) for remoulding back into the new bottles and jars. Glass can take up to 1000 years to breakdown in landfill but recycling glass only requires only 40 per cent of the energy necessary to make glass from sand. Steel cansSteel tins are baled and sold to recyclers to be remade into steel products and packaging. Steel is ‘detinned’ to remove the thin layer of tin and is then heated using a furnace and mixed with other recycled scrap metal.The melted product is then poured into casters to make ingots. Steel is 100 per cent recyclable so these recycled steel ingots can be used to make new car bodies, cans, aerosols, bikes, BBQs, furniture and whitegoods.Aluminium cansAluminium cans and aerosols are baled and sent to a processing plant, where they are heated and melted in a furnace.The liquid metal is cast into ingots that are then rolled into sheets in a mill and sent to the manufactures to be made back into aluminium products such as can, aerosols, bikes, cars and even planes. Recycled aluminium is just as good quality as aluminium made straight from bauxite and is more environmentally friendly.Paper and cardboardBaled paper and cardboard is delivered to Visy’s recycling plant where it is shredded and mixed with water at high speed to create paper fibres. The pulp is passed through cleaning and screening equipment to remove plastic, dirt and staples and then heated to remove ink and glue and is treated with chemicals and heated to loosen the ink. The cleaned pulp is diluted with water and mixed with smaller amounts of paper making additives.The paper is then turned into new paper and cardboard products. Recycled paper and cardboard can be used to make packaging, industrial paper, tissues, newspapers, insulations, kitty litter and moulded cartons for eggs and fruit.Plastic containersPlastic is baled and sent to recycling plants where it is shredded into small pieces and then washed. A floatation process separates plastics that may be mixed together due to lids being left on the products. Plastic is melted and stretched into strands, cooled, and cut into pellets or ground into powder. The plastic pellets and powders are sent to manufactures to be moulded and cast back into plastic products and packaging. Recycled plastic is used to make new bottles and containers, wheelie bins, guideposts, fence pickets, irrigation pipes and fleece jumpers.



What happens to our garbage (red lid bin)?


The garbage in the red lid bin is currently taken to Clyde rail head where it is compacted into containers and railed down to a big hole in the ground about half way between Goulburn and Canberra (Woodlawn Bioreactor). The hole was left behind by a zinc, copper and lead mine, and since 2004 Veolia has been working to turn the contaminated site into one of Australia’s premier green energy facilities.At Woodlawn our waste is processed in a way that maximises the production of biogas. This is used to generate electricity, and in the last 10 years over four million tonnes of waste has been turned into 34.5 million cubic metres of methane. The site currently exports enough power to meet the needs of over 6,000 homes per annum.As significant as the bioreactor’s 6MW of electricity generation is, since 2011 it has been overshadowed by the output of 23 turbines generating 48.3MW, enough power to meet the needs of 23,000 homes.Generating electricity produces a lot of heat. Waste heat from the generators is used to warm water to just the right temperature to keep Barramundi happy. Woodlawn’s aquaculture facility produces 2.5 tonnes of this highly sought after fish.



What happens to our green waste (green lid bin)?


Green waste is currently delivered to Kimbriki Recycling and Waste Disposal Centre in Terrey Hills, where it is screened and processed by Australian Native Landscapes. It is mulched using a mechanical shredder and then composted to the Australian Standard. Processed compost and mulch is matured for 3-6 months before being sold to the public.General Issues with the recycling and recovery of resourcesThe issue of interstate transportation and landfill levies is not new. The solution is a harmonised approach to landfill levies across Australia, which need to be set at a high enough level to reflect the true cost of landfilling, and to encourage alternative recycling approaches.NSW has the highest levies, and it’s also investing the most back into the resource recovery sector, with over $800 million being returned from the levy. Meanwhile Queensland has one of the worst recycling rates in Australia.Stockpiling is a standard management practice for recyclers, until sustainable markets are found for recycled products.Recycling needs to be commercially viable, and can be achieved through the purchase of products that are made with recycled materials.Production of a high quality product free of contamination and a reduction in the use of virgin materials requires additional costs of re-processing such that we can actually utilise almost the entire recycled product.



Should I take my bins with me when I move?


No. They belong to Hornsby Shire Council and must remain at the property.



There is no recycling/garbage/green waste bin at my property. How can I get one?


If you are renting contact your real estate agent who will arrange a bin for you.If you own the property, please call Council’s Waste Hotline on 13 70 30.



My bin has been lost, stolen or damaged. What should I do?


Call Council’s Waste Hotline on 13 70 30 and we will organise to replace or repair your bin.



The bins I’ve been provided aren’t big enough. Can I get extra bins?


Yes, though this will attract an additional charge. For more information, click here.



How should I place my bins for collection?


Place bins one metre apart and two metres from any obstruction, such as a car or tree. Bring the bins back onto your property as soon as possible after collection.



Why has only one side of the street had bins collected?


The driver has probably gone to empty the truck and will return. If this has not occurred by 4pm please call Council’s Waste Hotline on 13 70 30.



Why has my entire street been missed?


This may be due to driver error or your street may have been blocked by vehicles or roadworks. If collection has not occurred by 4pm call Council’s Waste Hotline on 13 70 30 and a truck will return the following day.



Why has my bin only been partially emptied?


Rubbish sometimes becomes compacted in the bottom of your bin and may not fall out when upturned. Loosen any remaining material and contact Council’s Waste Hotline on 13 70 30 to arrange the garbage truck’s return.



Can I put extra items for collection into plastic bags or boxes?


No. All items for collection must fit into the bins provided and the lid must close. If you need extra bins, click here.



Where can I take other items for recycling that are not accepted in my yellow lid recycling bin?


Visit Planet Ark’s website, SUEZ website or visit your nearest Waste Management Centre.



I have just moved and my large cardboard boxes won’t fit in my yellow lid recycling bin. Do you have an alternative service?


Flattened cardboard boxes can be taken to the Thornleigh Community Recycling Centre or the Mount Kuring-gai Household Recycling Drop Off, free of charge.



Who sorts the recycling?


Once collected, your recycling is taken to a material recovery facility in Sydney. The truck unloads unsorted recycling (paper, plastics, glass, etc) onto conveyor belts and then the sorting process begins. Air jets are used to separate paper, regular magnets are used to pick up steel cans, eddie current magnets are used to repel aluminium into containers, while lasers identify and sort glass into different types and colours. Other materials are sorted by hand, such as items too contaminated for recycling (for instance dirty steel cans or mouldy cardboard). Once sorted, the materials are sent to specialist recycling plants.



What can I do with hazardous waste such as chemicals and needles?


Hazardous waste include:ChemicalsNeedles and medical sharpsMedicinesRead our Hazardous Waste page for ways to dispose of these items.



When is the next Bulky Waste Collection due in my area?


You can view specific information about your waste collection here.



What can I put out for my Bulky Waste Collection?


For details visit the Bulky Waste Collection page or call Council’s Waste Hotline on 13 70 30.



How much can I put out for Bulky Waste Collection?


You can view the maximum permitted volumes of bulky waste here.



Where can I purchase compost bins and worm farms?


At Council’s Waste Depot at 29 Sefton Rd, Thornleigh. However, first call 13 70 30 to ensure there is stock. For addition information visit Composting and Worm Farming.



What do I do with my bins if my property will be unoccupied for a long period or I am in the process of a knockdown/rebuild?


Phone Council's Waste Hotline on 13 70 30  and we will arrange to have the bins removed. Once we have removed the bins, your waste service charges will be suspended until you request replacement bins.

Pollution incident or a concern

Water Pollution occurs when a substance enters the water and causes a change to the physical, chemical, or biological condition of the water. Water pollution also includes the depositing of a substance in a place where it may enter the water by falling into, be washed into, be blown into or percolate into a storm water drainage system.Regulatory powers are available to Council Officers to address water pollution incidents, pursuant to Part 5.3 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997. The regulatory powers are not only available for incidents where pollutants have been introduced directly to a creek or river, but equally applies to any pollution introduced to an area that is likely to travel to a stormwater drainage system (which in turn will drain to a local creek or waterway).Some of the common types and sources of water pollution are:Sediment run-off from construction sitesSewerage overflowsSoap suds from washing cars and boats on the street or drivewayPaint from washing paintbrushes over a stormwater inletWashing down concrete equipment on the roadwayHigh pressure washing of roofs and allowing runoff to enter the stormwater systemSwimming pool overflow during high rainfall eventsCigarette butts and other waste material being deposited on the roadway.

Share








Duty PlannerA Duty Planner is available for telephone enquiries between 8.30am-12.30pm and 2pm-4.30pm Monday to Friday to provide general town planning advice.To access the Duty Planner service you will need to book an appointment through our on-line booking system. All appointments are for a maximum of 10 minutes and you will need to answer some standard questions in order for us to ensure that your enquiry is efficiently directed.The Duty Planner's main function is to direct customers to relevant planning policies. The Duty Planner cannot provide zoning advice, pre-purchase enquiries, review your plans or advise you of the approval process for exempt or complying development.For pre-purchase enquiries, please see the Section 10.7 Planning Certificate contained within the contract for sale and information found at the NSW Planning Portal. If your pre-purchase enquiries relate to information on covenants or easements, please speak to your conveyancer for details within the contract for sale.For enquiries related to conditions relating to a Development Application, please contact the assessing officer at devmail@hornsby.nsw.gov.auThe Duty Planner is unable to go through all of Council's controls in detail or provide a detailed assessment of any development proposal you may be considering. If this is required, you may need to engage your own planning consultant or book a Pre-lodgement meeting.It is recommended that you book a Pre-lodgement meeting for any large or more complex proposals prior to submitting your application to Council.Prior to contacting the Duty Planner you should review Council’s Frequently Asked Questions and Hornsby Development Control Plan.Dual Occupancies and Semi Detached DwellingsThe State Environmental Planning Policy (Housing) Amendment (Dual Occupancies and Semi-detached Dwellings) 2024 (Amendment SEPP) commenced operation on 1 July 2024.For more information on this policy - Please check frequently asked questions - Dual Occupancies and Semi-detached Dwellings Online Booking Duty PlannerPre-lodgement meeting (Pre - DA)A pre-lodgement meeting gives you feedback from Council on the technical and merit aspects of a development proposal. Staff will look at your plans and documents, then give you advice on the best way forward.These meetings are encouraged by Council because:it's the best way to deal with complex or site-specific issuesit's an opportunity for Council to advise the applicant of strategic objectives for the development of the areait allows for any potential issues to be dealt with prior to the formal lodgement of a DAit helps the applicant resolve any issues prior to lodging an applicationit may assist in reducing the assessment time of the DA.Where possible Council officers will suggest alternative and acceptable solutions for the applicant to consider.A pre-lodgement meeting is for discussion and clarification purposes only and may not identify all possible issues. It is not intended to pre-empt a final decision in relation to a development application.Additional pre-lodgement meetings may be required at a later time, if considered necessary. This usually occurs with large, complex proposals and allows additional or revised information and documentation to be reviewed prior to submission of the DA.There is a fee from $414.00 for a pre-lodgement meeting and administration fee.Submit a Pre-Lodgement Meeting RequestPlease note: Pre-lodgement meetings will be conducted by teleconference.Due to unforeseen staff shortages, Pre-Lodgement meetings can take up to 4-8 weeks before a meeting can take place. For smaller scale developments (e.g. dwellings and alterations and additions) it is encouraged to discuss your application with the duty town planner or seek your own professional advice.Written AdviceIf you require more detailed planning information you can write to Council and request a response in writing. Council will give you detailed information in respect to issues such as Exempt and Complying development, dwelling entitlement, historic or current development application information, etc.The request must be clear and to the point.

Awnings over Public Land

Hornsby Shire Council is introducing an awning safety awareness program to raise awareness of the potential safety issues caused by awnings that extend over public footpaths or public land. Council is encouraging land owners to have their awnings checked by suitably qualified persons to ensure they are structurally sound.The program involves:Identifying owners of buildings with awnings over public land (including Council owned buildings) within Council Business ZonesNotifying owners of their responsibilities to keep their awnings in good order in all conditions, including during stormsAdvising owners to seek legal advice about liability for failure or collapse of their awning; andAdvising owners that awnings more than 10 years old are more susceptible to failure and should be inspected by a professional engineer for structural adequacy. Please refer to Practice Note No. 18 ‘Inspection and Assessment of Existing Tied Awnings’ for further details of the processes for the determination of awning safety.The program follows the receipt of the NSW Department of Planning and Environment circulars regarding awning safety in response to deaths in Bathurst and Balgowlah as a result of unsafe awnings collapsing.Council expects owners to take positive and prompt action to ensure their buildings and the public remain safe. Staff will provide necessary advice and assistance to facilitate this process, especially where repair works are necessary.Frequently Asked Questions




What do I have to do?

It is recommended that you have your awning checked by suitably qualified persons to ensure it is structurally sound and maintain your awning by removing leaves and debris from gutters. If your awning is more than 10 years old it is recommended that it is inspected by a professional structural engineer for structural adequacy.



Where can I find a suitably qualified structural engineer?

General internet searches may be helpful for locating structural engineers in your area. Also ensure that you only use qualified, licenced engineers.



Where can I find a company that can repair or install awnings?

General internet searches may be helpful for locating shop awning installers in your area. Also ensure that you only use qualified, licenced and insured companies.



Do I need any approvals to carry out repairs or rebuild my awning?

Generally only minor building works and repairs may be able to be carried out as exempt development. It is strongly recommended that you contact Council with details of proposed works to check whether any development approvals are needed prior to any works commencing. The construction of any new awnings or replacement of existing awnings must have approval prior to any construction. Approval for awnings is required by a complying development certificate or development approval.Further information can be obtained by contacting Council’s Duty Town Planner.

Market Sounding


Council is continuously working to reduce its carbon emissions through investment in renewable energy initiatives. Council is now looking for further opportunities to reduce its carbon footprint through the investigation of next-generation technologies that will increase Council’s long-term financial sustainability and deliver on its inter-generational social responsibilities.Council recognises that the renewable energy landscape and technology more broadly is evolving at an increasingly rapid rate, as are the commercial arrangements for their creation and application. Consequently, Council is proposing to undertake an expression of interest process for the provision of next generation renewable energy applications that can be delivered through leveraging existing Council-owned land and or facilities.However, before embarking on any formal procurement process Council is undertaking a ‘Market Sounding’ process. It is anticipated that this process will:improve Council’s knowledge of the renewable energy infrastructure market and assist Council in understanding the industry’s value drivers and financial constraints in the provision of renewable energy infrastructure for local governmentenable industry to advise Council of information that it may wish to consider including within the expression of interest documentation and how this information may assist potential proponents in the expression of interest process, andallow Council to engage in open and transparent dialogue with organisations within the renewable energy industry to assure the quality of the subsequent expression of interest process and the information provided to proponents as part of this process.Using the following criteria Council has identified several companies that it believes are well-placed to provide this initial advice. However, Council is willing to consider discussions with other organisations that meet this criterion:Experience in a variety of renewal energy technologiesExperience delivering commercial renewal energy projectsPrevious engagement by government organisations for the delivery of renewable energy technologiesExperience and capacity in the development of designs for renewable energy infrastructureExperience in Public Private Partnerships or arrangements where public infrastructure is provided through private sector financingMembership of recognised professional body within the renewable energy industry.It is important to note that this process is not a procurement process. Council is not seeking information on particular types of technologies or their application, nor the merits of individual organisations or their capabilities. Any supply of future goods and services in relation to this initiative will be open to all organisations as part of the following Expression of Interest process.If you believe your organisation meets the before-mentioned criteria and would like further information in relation to this process, please contact Gary Parsons at gpenviro80@gmail.com, who is coordinating this process on behalf of Council.Participation in the ‘Market Sounding’ process does not imply any registration, pre-qualification or any other preferred status in respect of involvement in any future procurement.Organisations will not be recompensed for their participation in this process.Organisations which do not participate in this market sounding process will not be prejudiced in any way in respect of any subsequent procurement process in relation to this, or any other Council project.

Wards and Boundaries

​​​​Up until May 2016, the Hornsby Shire Council area covered approximately 510 square kilometres, including 6,000 hectares of public bushland for which Council was responsible. The Shire extended from Brooklyn in the north, to Wisemans Ferry and Glenorie/Dural in the west, Wahroonga in the east and Epping in the south.In May 2016 the NSW Government transferred the former Hornsby Shire Council area south of the M2 Motorway to the City of Parramatta Council and abolished Hornsby’s then existing three-ward structure.By proclamation on 23 January 2017, the State Government established a new three ward structure for the Hornsby Shire Council area which took effect from the 9 September 2017​ Council election.Hornsby Shire LGA Boundary Map

Fire Safety

.Essential fire safety services are active measures to afford protection of a building and the safe evacuation of persons in the event of a fire emergency.Annual Fire Safety StatementEvery year the owner of a building or premises (including residential flat buildings, commercial, industrial or public buildings that are class 2 – 9 Building Code of Australia) must provide Council and Fire & Rescue NSW with a statement certifying that all essential fire-safety measures are properly maintained and functional. When completed, the statement must be displayed in a prominent position in the building.All building owners and property managers must maintain essential fire safety measures in their buildings, as outlined in the Environmental Planning and Assessment (Development Certification and Fire Safety) Regulation 2021.Clause 81 of the Regulation requires the owner of a building maintain each essential fire safety measure in that building in accordance with relevant standards of performance. The standards of performance are found in the Fire Safety Schedule for the building. The Fire Safety Schedule for the building forms part of either a change of use development consent, construction certificate, complying development certificate or fire safety order.This clause places ultimate responsibility for the maintenance of fire safety measures on the building owner.Apart from legal requirements, other vital reasons for maintaining fire safety measures include:ensuring safety of building occupants;preserving the function and performance of fire safety systems and equipment;maintaining and protecting assets – proper preventative maintenance can save money; andavoiding business interruption and disruption to activities/operations in the event of fire.Building owners will need to select an APFS - Accredited practitioner (fire safety) or a registered certifier to undertake the necessary assessments and inspections before an annual statement or supplementary fire statement is issued.For further information about APFS, please visit the NSW Planning Website.The assessment and inspection of the essential fire safety measures must have been carried out within the three-month period prior to the issue date of the annual fire safety statement.Once an APFS has assessed each measure and the owner has signed and completed the statement, lodge the statement with Council and with Fire & Rescue NSW via their website at: Annual Fire Safety Statement Lodgement. Please note there is an administration fee payable to Council for lodging this statement.Fire safety certificateFor new or altered buildings, upon the completion of work and prior to occupation, a fire safety certificate must be provided to Council & Fire and Rescue NSW via their website at: Lodge a fire safety certificate. The fire safety certificate verifies the installation of each new or altered essential fire safety measure.Within 12 months after the date of the fire safety certificate, an annual fire safety statement must be provided to the Council. This process is ongoing and each year an annual certificate must be submitted within 12 months of the last statement.Fire safety schedulesFire safety schedules list the measures required to be installed and the standard they need to achieve. A fire safety schedule is normally issued:by Council or an accredited certifier in accompaniment of a construction certificate or complying development certificateby Council in accompaniment of a fire safety orderby Council in some cases with a development consent (where there is a change of building use).Essential Fire Safety MeasuresEssential fire safety measures include installations, equipment or forms of construction that will protect occupants of a building in the event of emergencies. They include but are not limited to the following examples:automatic fire detection and alarm systemsautomatic fire suppression systems, such as sprinkler systemsemergency lighting and exit signsfire hose reels, fire hydrants and portable fire extinguishersfire doors and mechanical air-handling systemslightweight fire-resistant construction materialsOffences and PenaltiesFailure to supply an AFSS is an offence under 89(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment (Development Certification and Fire Safety) Regulation 2021, for which the following penalties apply:1 week late $1,0002 weeks late an additional $2,0003 weeks late an additional $3,0004 weeks late an additional $4,000Please note, where a penalty notice is issued to a property owner, an AFSS is still required to be submitted.In circumstances where an AFSS cannot be submitted on time, a request for an extension must be sought prior to the due date. To support your application, you are required to provide a timeline for the completion of works and supporting documentation such as defect reports and quotations. Where possible a partial statement should be submitted. Please note that Council is unlikely to approve applications involving poor building site management.Combustible CladdingLightweight cladding in its predominant form of aluminium sandwich panels can permit the spread of fire rapidly along the external façade of a building posing a risk to public health and safety. Multi storey buildings are particularly at risk from the rapid spread of fire where lightweight cladding has been fixed and connects consecutive storeys.For further information about combustible cladding, please visit the NSW Planning Website.

River testingA healthy Hawkesbury River is essential for many people within Hornsby Shire, the oyster farmers foremost among them. This short film follows one of Council's water testing teams as they make the rounds, while it also introduces an exciting innovation – electronic buoys that automatically test the water and send results direct to your computer or smart phone.

Trees





            Hornsby Shire is known for its bushland character and significant natural areas. Tree preservation measures are in place to protect our urban and bushland trees and vegetation.
        

Preserving our Bushland legacy





            Find out more about how to manage trees on your property and the procedure you must take to prune or remove a tree.
        

Trees on Private Property





            Council has no power to compel a neighbour to prune or remove a tree. If you have a concern about a neighbour's tree, it is best to resolve the issue by having a friendly discussion with them.
        

Trees on Neighbouring Property





            If you are concerned by a tree on Council land, or if you consider  that a Council owned or managed tree is damaging footpaths, posing a hazard or potential hazard to persons or property, you may lodge a request for Council to prune, remove or make safe the tree.

Hornsby Shire Council Local Planning Panel

The Council of the Shire of Hornsby Local Planning Panel ‘the panel’ was constituted by the Minister Planning on 1 March 2018. The Panel comprises qualified people independent of Council that have the functions of a Council as a consent authority under Part 4 to determine a range of development applications that have an estimated development cost less than $30 million. The Panel also has an advisory function, offering advice to Council prior to its consideration on whether to prepare and refer a planning proposal to the Minister or Greater Sydney Commission for Gateway Determination.Elected Councillors no longer decide the outcome of individual development applications and are instead referred to the Panel for consideration and determination. Council officers still assess the development application and then reports it to the Panel. The panel reviews the application and the officer’s assessment and makes a determination.In August 2020, the NSW Government made changes to the way Local Planning Panels work to make them more efficient and to improve the assessment and determination times of development applications and maintain panel oversight of sensitive and contentious applications.The changes will speed up panel determinations by:Reducing the need to conduct public panel meetings for non-contentious matters by applying a ‘10-or-more’ objection trigger for public meetings.Reducing the amount of modifications going to panelsObliging panel chairs to more actively manage development applications (DAs) coming to the panels to reduce panel deferrals and assessment timeframes.Allowing chairs to bring forward determination on DAs that are experiencing unreasonable delays of over 180 days from lodgement.Introducing panel performance measures.The Panel inspects a site prior to determination of the application and provides a transparent forum for applicants and objectors to make verbal submissions.All decisions made by the Panel are final.

Citizen Science

The Bushland Shire has a strong history of community activism, especially around bushland protection, conservation of endangered species and water quality.Citizen Science is a great way to harness community skills and passion to fuel the capacity of science to answer our questions about the world and how it works. It also helps raise awareness and community understanding of the value of biodiversity and healthy waterways within our local catchments.Want to learn more about Citizen Science?

Fire Management

Bush fire is both an inevitable and essential part of the Australian environment. They are also known to pose a significant threat to life, property and to the environment itself.Greater Sydney is one of the most bush fire-prone areas in Australia and Hornsby Shire is one of the most vulnerable to bush fire risk with 34 per cent of properties (being 19,804 properties, covering an area of 41,362 hectares) currently identified as Bush Fire Prone land.With so many properties being close to bushland reserves and National Parks, bush fire management and preparation is an important priority for the residents of Hornsby Shire. While these locations are highly valued, they can be exposed to bush fire risk. The best way to manage bush fire and its risk is by working together as whole community.






            Council’s bush fire management strategy is guided by the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai bush fire Risk Management Plan.
        

Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Bush Fire Risk Management Plan





            With many of Hornsby Shire's residents living in or near bushland, bush fire management and preparation is an important part Hornsby Shire Council's responsibilities.
        

What does Council do to help reduce bush fire risk?





            bush fire management and preparation is an important part of our lives in Hornsby Shire. Over one third of residents live close to bushland reserves and National Parks.
        

What can you do to reduce your bush fire risk?





            Various approvals/fire permits are required to burn off piles of vegetation in the open within Hornsby Shire, at all times of the year.
        

Approval to Burn a Pile of Vegetation





            A bush fire prone area contains or is near vegetation that could come under bush fire attack.
        

Bush Fire Prone Land Map





            Our bushland has adapted to live with bush fire. Let's do the same.

Services for Businesses







            Hornsby Shire Council commercial waste services for local businesses.
        

Waste Services for Businesses





            Council is pursuing a place making approach for our Shire because we understand that when the community loves a place, enormous social, cultural and economic value are added to that community.
        

My Place





            Choose a business advisor and access informative workshops and events to set your business up for success.
        

Business Connect





            Apply for the government licences and permits you need to open your business faster.
        

Easy to do Business





            Did you know that as a NSW Government supplier you can get paid instantly? This applies if you supply goods or services under $10,000 and your small business accepts credit card payment.
        

Faster Payment Terms for Small Business





            Organisations may request Council to install directional street signs to either an existing post or a new post installed for the purpose of the new sign.
        

Directional Signs





            ‘Futureproofing your business’ is the ability to be sustain-able beyond disruption: This means not only doing your part for prevention - saving water, recycling, saving energy, minimising waste - but also being aware of potential threats and planning now for what to do when disaster strikes.

So much to learn, so much to loveTall and handsome Sydney Blue Gums (Eucalyptus saligna) tower up to 50 metres high with smooth, blueish-grey trunks and their signature brown bark “socks” at their base. They’re one of the most common tree species making up the ecological community known as 'Blue Gum High Forest' and you will often find them contrasted amongst luminescent green fernery and other forest stunners.




A rare kind of love

So RareOnly an estimated 5% of the original Blue Gum High Forest remains. This ecological community has specific soil and rainfall requirements that limit where it can occur. The critically endangered Blue Gum High Forest’s survival is overwhelmingly dependent on Hornsby Shire and its people.Where love growsBlue Gum High Forest grows in 14 suburbs within Hornsby Shire, in and amongst the places where over 99,000 people live. If you live in or near these suburbs, then Blue Gum High Forest is your neighbour: Arcadia, Beecroft, Castle Hill, Cherrybrook, Dural, Galston, Glenhaven, Hornsby, Normanhurst, Pennant Hills, Thornleigh, Wahroonga, Westleigh, West Pennant Hills.Why does it only grow in a third of Hornsby Shire’s suburbs?Blue Gum High Forest has specific soil and rainfall requirements which, when added together, limit where it can grow. Some trees in a Blue Gum High Forest need rich, deep soils to support their straight and tall growth. Such soils form from weathered shale rock or have volcanic origins. The second essential ingredient is a rainfall total above 1100mm (on average) per year. Where Hornsby Shire’s suburbs have this soil and rainfall combination, and where it hasn’t been cleared, you will find Blue Gum High Forest.Jurassic Park on your doorstepHornsby Shire contains 40% of the world’s Blue Gum High Forest! Yet, within some of our patches grows an even rarer sub-type of Blue Gum High Forest called 'Blue Gum Diatreme Forest'.This 14-hectare sub-forest community of outstanding majesty is so rare it can only be found in Hornsby Valley or nearby Fox Valley. It gets its name because it occurs on soils formed from eroding diatremes - volcanic pipes of magma that forced their way to the surface some 200 million years ago when dinosaurs roamed the Earth.



Whoo whoo loves the forest?

Blue Gum High Forest is not just a stand of majestic trees. Rather, it's a unique and complex community of plants, animals, fungi, and other organisms. Everything living in or visiting an ecological community contributes to its health.Ecological communities are created by nature over thousands of years, so once it is gone, it cannot be replaced.Meet your (wild) neighboursMany species making up Blue Gum High Forest are quite common, however others, such as the powerful owl, glossy black-cockatoo, and several microbats are currently threatened with extinction.Photo credits: 1. Large bent-winged bats (Miniopterus orianae oceanensis) - Alex Pike/DCCEEW2. Powerful owl (Ninox strenua)3. Female glossy black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami)Protecting threatened wildlife = protecting hollowsOne key feature of Blue Gum High Forest is the hollows that form in mature trees. These play a vital role in providing homes and nesting sites for many native animals.The powerful owl, for example, is Australia's largest owl and its survival depends on large hollows that usually only form in trees at least 150 years old. Similarly, the glossy black-cockatoo requires large hollows of at least a metre in depth, so it too relies on trees aged over 150 years for breeding.Due to the former logging industry of Hornsby Valley which sought the timber of the tallest Sydney blue gums; expansive farmland clearing, and ridgeline suburb expansion where Blue Gum High Forest normally thrives, our local wildlife is faced with a critical shortage of large hollow bearing, older trees. It is crucial, therefore, that we preserve mature tree hollows by protecting standing trees (both living and dead) wherever possible.ResourcesFor an in-depth Blue Gum High Forest profile go to the Australian Government’s Species Profile and Threats Database for the Blue Gum High Forest of the Sydney Basin Bioregion Or try the NSW Government’s Threatened biodiversity profile search tool.



Threats and heartbreak

When an outpost of the British Empire settled in Sydney some 240 years ago, Blue Gum High Forest quickly became highly regarded for its straight, tall trees and its rich, moist soils. Its trees were felled for their timbers, and the forest was progressively cleared for agriculture. With transport corridors concentrated on the ridge lines where it mainly grows, and with increasingly dense urban development, Blue Gum High Forest was almost squeezed out of existence. Today less than 5% of its area remains, and Blue Gum High Forest is facing an extremely high risk of extinction. In fact, less than 200 hectares of Blue Gum High Forest exists on the entire planet, and the scattered and narrow patches left are under immense pressure.Blue Gum High Forest is listed by the NSW Government and the Australian Government as a critically endangered ecological community. Once it is gone, it cannot be replaced!The small amount of Blue Gum High Forest remaining is subject to pressures that threaten its health and survival. Sustainably looked after for tens of thousands of years by traditional custodians, everything changed for Blue Gum High Forest when Europeans arrived in Hornsby Shire. Beginning in the late 1700s, trees were felled for timber followed by wide-spread clearing of the forest for farming. With the construction of railway lines and road expansion, suburbs replaced the once-rural areas. As Sydney's population grew, land-use development continued a-pace and the forest was almost squeezed out of existence. You can find out more by reading Hornsby Thematic History.Today, Blue Gum High Forest is still under threat from many factors. Left alone and without help, these negative impacts would accumulate, and Blue Gum High Forest could quickly decline and become extinct.WeedsExotic plants, including weeds and garden escapees, constantly enter bushland and can take over all layers of a forest. This is especially the case along bushland edges and waterways, and in small or narrow patches of bushland that are surrounded by development. Think again if you don’t believe there are plants that can overpower the mighty Sydney Blue Gum and other canopy trees. Groundcover weeds such as Wandering Trad (Tradescantia fluminensis) can completely block the light reaching the forest floor. No matter how robust the tree, their seeds and seedlings need space and light to germinate and grow. This can’t happen with a thick blanket of weeds covering the ground.StormwaterAs deep soils are replaced by concrete and bitumen for roads and footpaths, and buildings and facilities for the Shire’s growing population, there is increasingly less space for rain to be slowly absorbed into the ground where it falls. Now when it rains, urban creeks become raging torrents fed by pipes and gutters channelling water that has fallen on these hard surfaces quickly into our natural waterways and bushland. Along the way, this stormwater will carry with it any seeds or plant parts swept up in its path, loose soils, and nutrients such as fertilisers. With creeks flowing higher and faster than is natural, stormwater can reach far into bushland, laying down nutrient-rich sediments. Many bushland weeds thrive in these conditions and their growth can out-compete the native bushland plants. With much bushland located downslope of developed areas, water shedding directly from neighbouring properties can also give weeds the upper hand on the edges of bushland. Council’s Catchment Remediation Program of the last few decades continues to reduce the magnitude of these impacts. Council’s Water Sensitive Hornsby Strategy assesses the Shire’s water sensitive performance and sets a Vision for 2040.DumpingDumping is where natural or manufactured materials are taken into the forest, or moved within the forest, and left there. Natural materials include soil, rock and garden or tree prunings. Manufactured materials found in bushland include concrete and other building materials, discarded items such as furniture, and waste. Building up land or dumping material on top of the forest’s natural ground surface can starve the soil of oxygen and light. Seeds can’t germinate beyond a certain depth, and roots and other living things below the ground need oxygen to survive. The patch of forest affected cannot regenerate and its health declines.ClearingClearing of Blue Gum High Forest is not just limited to the cutting down of trees but involves the removal or killing of any of the plants (including shrubs, grasses and groundcovers) which make up this unique ecological community. Unauthorised clearing is a threat to the survival of Blue Gum High Forest. It includes private properties encroaching onto public land to create extra space, cutting or poisoning of trees and plants to improve views or access to sunlight or to prevent leaves and branches dropping into properties, track building to access natural areas and concerns about bush fire. Depending on the extent, some of these activities can be authorised by governments, including local Councils and state and national governments. If not authorised, and because of the critically endangered status of Blue Gum High Forest, these clearing activities can be considered illegal.Clearing of Blue Gum High Forest is exacerbated by the digging up of soil by hand tools or machines. Blue Gum High Forest contains many living things below the ground surface. Digging up soil damages the future of the forest (in the location it occurs) by removing roots and vital stores of seed and the underground stems, bulbs and tubers of various plants. Digging also damages the roots of trees and other plants that grow alongside the cleared area.Depending on the extent, some clearing activities can be authorised by governments, including local Councils. The reason why approvals may be granted is to provide places for people to live, work and recreate, or to manage risks to life and property. Any approval process requires rigorous environmental assessments, and options must be considered that reduce or eliminate any impacts on the forest.DiseasePhytophthora and Myrtle Rust are exotic pathogens that damage bushland ecology and cause the death of plants in certain susceptible areas. These diseases can be spread by people moving through bushland and unknowingly picking up pathogens on their shoes and clothes.



How Council helps

Guided by Council’s Biodiversity Conservation Strategy, Council has specialised staff and contractors who work to protect and repair bushland in parks and reserves and in selected unmade road reserves. Bush regeneration contractors restore bushland at around 80 sites across the Shire, including 21 Blue Gum High Forest sites. Bushcare volunteers work at 65 sites across the Shire, guided by specialist site supervisors employed by Council. Twelve (12) of these Bushcare groups work at Blue Gum High Forest sites.Entrusted with looking after a precious forest teetering on the edge of extinction, Council must carefully assess and plan any work and activities that could damage Blue Gum High Forest in parks and reserves. With the aim being the forest’s long-term survival, Council conducts and supports plant and animal surveys to measure the forest’s health and to keep an eye on its wildlife and other dependents. A sound understanding of each patch of Blue Gum High Forest and its place in the Shire’s wider bushland network is essential. From an environmental impact perspective, the location and design of any proposed tracks and trails, shared pathways, play spaces and stormwater drainage devices (to name just a few) can be guided by survey findings. Options can be considered, and decisions made to ensure protection of critically endangered forests into the future is given the highest priority.Council warmly invites the community to visit the parks and reserves where Blue Gum High Forest grows to experience its majesty and to appreciate and understand the ways of nature. Critical to the survival of the forest are human interactions that support its health and ongoing sustainability. As for precious works of art like Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa or Michelangelo’s David, access to and through Blue Gum High Forest must be appropriate and carefully managed.







Help #SayHighForest not "Bye Forest" There are so many ways we can all help protect Blue Gum High Forest




Join a Bushcare volunteer group


Becoming a Bushcare volunteer is an enjoyable way to learn about Blue Gum High Forest with like-minded people.There are 12 Bushcare groups working in Blue Gum High Forest. Each group is guided by a specialist site supervisor employed by Council.Blue Gum High Forest Bushcare GroupsBeecroft - Cassia Grove - 3rd Monday of the month, 1–4 pmBeecroft - Chilworth Reserve - every Friday, 9 am – 12 pmBeecroft - Fearnley Park - 1st Friday of the month, 8–11 amBeecroft - Hull Road - 2nd Saturday of the month, 8–10 amBeecroft - Observatory Park - 1st Saturday of the month, 9 am – 12 pmCherrybrook - The Lakes of Cherrybrook - 4th Thursday of the month, 9 am – 12 pmHornsby - Ginger Meggs - 1st Saturday of the month, 1–4 pmHornsby - Rosemead Road - last Sunday of the month, 9 am – 12 pmNormanhurst - Kenley Park - 1st Saturday of the month, 1–4 pmWahroonga - Netherby Street - 4th Monday of the month, 9 am – 12 pmWest Pennant Hills - Campbell Park - 3rd Saturday of the month, 8–11 amWest Pennant Hills - New Farm Road - every Monday, 8:30–11:30 amWith a variety of days, times and locations available there is sure to be a Bushcare group to suit you.Become a Bushcare volunteer




Come along to a community planting event


If you want to help the forest but are short on time, why not come along to a community planting event!Held on a weekend, community plantings are for everyone, young and old alike. Most events are booking-free, so you can simply turn up and lend a hand for any length of time (between 30 minutes and 2 hours).Usually located on the edge of bushland in a Council park or reserve, the planting sites are suitable for those with a basic level of fitness and for children (under the supervision of their parent or a carer).There are roughly three open community planting events held per year, including in rare forests such as Blue Gum High Forest. Sign up to receive Council’s free e-newsletters so you never miss a community planting event, or other great activities in our Shire.




Ensure cats stay inside


Protect your cat by keeping it within your premises!Did you know the average lifespan of a cat kept indoors is 12 years, whereas cats allowed to roam outside live an average of three years?For the safety of our forest’s wildlife it is also best to keep your cat indoors, especially at night.“Roaming domestic cats kill about 60 million birds a year and feral cats are a major cause of mammal extinction.”- Federal Government Threatened Species Commissioner (2017)Cats found in Wildlife Protection Areas can be caught and the owner will incur a penalty of $180 under Section 3.0 of the Act.Find tips for how to protect your cat and our wildlife in the Wildlife Protection Areas of Hornsby Shire brochure.




Keep dogs on leads and remove their droppings on Council managed bushland


Keep dogs on leads, stick to the managed tracks and trails and remove their droppings when in bushland.Dogs are NOT permitted to enter national parks in NSW, except for trained assistance dogs accompanying people with a disability. However, they are permitted in Hornsby Shire Council-managed bushland where it is essential that dogs stay on leads, stick to managed tracks and trails, and dog droppings are picked up and disposed of properly, away from the forest.Why our forests don’t do, dog pooRemoving dog droppings is not simply for the comfort of other walkers. Other reasons to pick up and remove dog droppings include:Dog droppings add substantial amounts of fertilising nutrients to the naturally low-nutrient, native bushland. Overfertilisation reduces biodiversity by significantly boosting the growth of weeds, allowing weeds to drive out other plants (and the wildlife that depends on those plants). Added to the concentrated nutrients, the scratching made by dogs creates disturbed soil areas that further encourage weed growth.The nutrients from dog droppings also move in the groundwater and can encourage algae blooms in creeks and other waterbodies.Parasites present in dog droppings can live for years in soil where it has been left to break down, risking wildlife infection.The scent of dog droppings can scare away native wildlife, throwing the delicate ecosystem further out of balance.Dog droppings can attract foxes that kill native wildlife.Why your dog needs to stay on a leadEven if you feel your dog won’t attack wildlife when off leash, the forest’s wildlife will still perceive your dog as a predator and they will become easily scared, modifying their behaviours that lead to a chain reaction, negatively impacting an entire forest ecosystem.It is critical that your dog not only stays on a lead, but you both keep to Council-managed tracks and trails. When dogs rub against dense trees and shrubbery, or leave their scent by urinating or through droppings, this is enough to disturb native wildlife and further modify their behaviours.Wildlife that feed, nest or travel on or near ground level are particularly vulnerable to dogs. This includes the beautiful superb lyrebird and the Bassian thrush, who both live in some Blue Gum High Forest areas of Hornsby Shire. If these animals are scared away, then the work they do to keep the ecosystem balanced, (like eating small critters that live on or near the forest floor) does not happen. This means that leeches can rapidly multiply, resulting in an unpleasant forest experience for us humans. More importantly, populations of insects that feed on, and can subsequently kill plants (such as young Sydney blue gum trees), may not be kept in check, endangering the long-term survival of the forest.Owners of dogs roaming in Wildlife Protection Areas can incur a penalty of $330 under Section 14 of the Companion Animals Act 1998. Download this Brochure for more info on caring for pets and protecting our wildlife in Wildlife Protection Areas of Hornsby Shire.

Don’t use second generation rat poison


Never use second generation rodent poisons, as they can also kill wildlife, such as owls, which feed on poisoned mice and rats.These rodent poisons are called anticoagulant rodenticides, and although the second generation variety of this product may “kill in just one feed”, the poison lingers in the environment and can continue to poison wildlife, even long after its original victim has perished.When wildlife (such as the threatened powerful owl) feed on poisoned rodents, they themselves become poisoned. A recent study by Birdlife Australia found second generation rodenticides present in 37 out of 38 livers (97%) of dead powerful owls, often at toxic (60%) and sometimes potentially lethal levels (11%)1Brodifacoum is the most common ingredient in second generation anticoagulant rodenticides in Australia and in another recent Australian study by Deakin University, it was detected in the livers of 55 out of 60 dead, native predatory birds (92%). 33% were found to have possibly lethal levels and significantly more had “possible toxicity” levels high enough to cause impairment.2How to identify (to avoid) second-generation mouse and rat poisons*You can see the words “Second generation anticoagulant rodenticide”.You DO NOT see the words “First generation anticoagulant rodenticide”.The product lists either Brodifacoum, Difenacoum or Bromadialone as the active ingredient.The pack mentions wording like “Kills with just one feed”.The pack is likely to claim, “Fast action” even though the fine print may mention that it is likely to take “on average 4 - 7 days (or longer) to kill rodents after consumption”.Sign Birdlife Australia’s petition to ask Bunnings to stop stocking second generation anticoagulant rodenticides; or write to your local member asking to change Australian laws1Read about Birdlife Australia’s study of the impact of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides on Powerful Owls2Read about Deakin University’s study about the impact of second-generation rodenticides on predatory birds.*Read Birdlife Australia’s guide of specific products to buy and to avoid.




Report any fox sightings to FoxScan


The red fox (Vulpes vulpes), introduced to NSW in the 1870s for recreational hunting, is a significant pest in all areas of NSW, including Hornsby Shire.Active mostly at night time, these highly efficient hunters can decimate wildlife populations, including regional declines and extinctions of a wide range of native animals. Medium-sized, ground-dwelling mammals (such as wallabies) and ground-nesting birds (such as superb lyrebirds), and freshwater turtles are especially vulnerable to fox predation.If you see a red fox, please report it using FoxScan. Information you record can be used to manage foxes more effectively and reduce the damage they cause.




Participate in (iNaturalist) citizen science


When visiting the forest, get your camera or smartphone out and record some of the biodiversity you encounter with iNaturalist. Hornsby Shire Council recommends using the iNaturalist.org website or the iNaturalist app (available on the iNaturalist.org website).iNaturalist is a crowd-sourced identification tool to help you, scientists and members of the community learn more about the environment. Anyone can use iNaturalist to record and easily identify the plants, animals, and other living things in your photos and audio recordings. It is available for researchers or for anyone wanting to find out more about nature. Confirmed observations become part of the Atlas of Living Australia, hosted by the CSIRO.It’s very easy to use and is a great learning tool, for absolute beginners right through to experienced naturalists. It even has the capacity to identify unseen living things. For example, you can submit evidence such as photos of animal tracks, nests and scats, and audio recordings. Visit the Hornsby Shire Council iNaturalist page




Never dump in the bush (including green waste)


Never dump construction materials, landscaping and vegetation or rubbish in bushland - penalties apply. Call 13 70 30 to report dumped waste.Dumping material on top of the forest’s natural ground surface can starve the soil of oxygen and light. Seeds can’t germinate without oxygen and roots and other living things below the ground need oxygen to survive. The patch of forest affected cannot regenerate and its health declines.In addition, if landscaping and vegetation are dumped, this will likely spread weeds, further harming the forest and damaging its ecosystem.Don’t simply assume your gardening or building contractor will do the right thing and dispose of materials and vegetation correctly. Always check.It is an offence to be both the transporter and the owner of dumped waste, disposed of anywhere that is not a lawful waste facility.Illegal dumping is punishable by on-the-spot fines, court-imposed penalties, and in some instances by imprisonment. Currently, on-the-spot fines for illegal dumping range from $2000 for minor offences to $8000 for more serious offences.Go to our Illegal dumping webpage for more info.




Don’t remove dead wood from the forest


Don’t remove wood from the forest for firewood or for any other reason.Even when wood is “dead” it is an essential part of the forest ecosystem. Dead wood provides:habitat for wildlife, such as the echidnafood for insects such as the fiddler beetle, one of our Shire’s important pollinatorsvital nutrients in the soil to feed the forest’s many plants and trees when the dead wood decomposes.Further to this, the insects that depend on dead wood to survive, themselves become an important part of the ecosystem’s food chain. For example, insects feeding on dead wood become food supply for the lyrebird attracting more wildlife to the area.



Contact Council


Report to Council any activities you suspect might be damaging Blue Gum High Forest.Call (02) 9847 6666 or email hsc@hornsby.nsw.gov.au.








 If you live near the forest, there’s even more you can do to help preserve it:




Plant some of the forest’s native species


Plant some of the forest’s native species, such as forest oak (Allocasuarina torulosa), muttonwood (Myrsine variabilis) flax lily (Dianella caerulea) and wonga wonga vine (Pandorea pandorana) in your garden. This will help attract birds, mammals and butterflies.Hornsby Shire ratepayers can take up the offer of free plants from Warada Ngurang Community Nursery, where volunteers and staff propagate the plants, both big and small, that grow in a Blue Gum High Forest. Pop them in your garden and you will be helping creatures such as moths, butterflies and native bees that feed on and help pollinate the forest’s plants. You will also be helping wildlife such as the rare glossy black-cockatoo, who depends on a handful of trees for its food, including the forest oak (Allocasuarina torulosa), a small tree that grows in Blue Gum High Forest.Below is a list of tree and plant species native to Blue Gum High Forest that you could plant in your garden or on rural acreage. Most are grown at Warada Ngurang Community Nursery.40 Blue Gum High Forest speciesSubscribe to Hornsby Shire Council’s e-newsletter to never miss a free native plant giveaway.




Never throw lawn clippings over your fence


It is extremely hazardous to throw lawn clippings and other vegetation into native bushland as it very often carries weeds and seeds - a significant threat to our fragile bushland. Our fantastic Bushcare volunteers spend hours every week removing weeds from bushland. You could help them and the forest by not letting your grass clippings or other garden vegetation enter bushland.



Be careful when mowing your lawn


Mowing underneath Blue Gum High Forest trees prevents seedlings from establishing. Hand weed or carefully spot-poison weeds instead. Mowing through native forest grasses or understory destroys a vital component of the Blue Gum High Forest ecosystem. Never extend your yard boundaries into bushland reserves, as it will likely eliminate the forest grasses, ferns and other plants that belong to the ecosystem.



Look after your trees


Please look after the trees of Blue Gum High Forest. If you are concerned about a tree on your, or your neighbour’s, property, please visit Trees on Private Property and find out about management options and whether a permit is required for any tree work. It is particularly important to avoid removing standing trees with hollows (alive or dead) and any branches or dense shrubbery near the hollows. This is the habitat that our precious forest owls and parrots need for breeding, and without these natural hollows we will lose them from our suburbs.




Be mindful with building activities


When pursuing building activities or landscaping, all efforts should be made to protect any trees, in particular Sydney blue gums and other canopy trees of Blue Gum High Forest. An arborist can assist to ensure these are kept in a safe condition.



Remove weeds from your garden


Remove weeds from your own garden to stop them spreading into the Blue Gum High Forest.Some of the most threatening weeds to the Blue Gum High Forest include:View the full gallery of common weeds




Install a rain garden


Rainwater falling onto hard surfaces, such as buildings and driveways, is unable to soak into the ground. This water, known as ‘stormwater run-off’, is channelled into stormwater pipes or flows quickly over the hard surface and into adjacent areas. Run-off into Blue Gum High Forest, or any bushland area, can cause soil erosion, prolific weed growth and native plant death due to excess moisture and nutrients.Installing a raingarden on your property can help the forest stay healthy. Raingardens protect forests and bushland by capturing, slowing down and filtering stormwater run-off before it enters our precious natural areas.

Pest and Nuisance Animals

The law in New South Wales defines a pest animal as any non-native species (other than humans) having an adverse effect on the environment, the economy or the community (S.15, Biosecurity Act 2015). Pest animals commonly found in Hornsby Shire include wild rabbits, red foxes, cats, common mynas and common carp. Other less common or potential pest animals in the Shire include wild dogs, wild pigs, wild deer and wild goats. Native animals and domestic pets that may at times pose a nuisance, are not categorised as pest animals.Native to Asia, the common myna (or ‘Indian’ myna) Acridotheres tristis is a pest animal frequently seen in built-up areas of the Shire, especially around shopping centres and school playgrounds.




How pest animals are managed


Under the New South Wales Biosecurity Act 2015, all non-native animals (except humans) are assessed for the risk they pose to the environment, community and the economy. Everyone who deals with animals (including a landholder allowing them to roam on their land) must prevent, eliminate or minimise this impact, as far as is reasonably practicable. This is termed a persons’ General Biosecurity Duty and must be discharged (S.22 Biosecurity Act 2015).Pest animals commonly found in Hornsby Shire, such as wild rabbits, red foxes, cats, common mynas and common carp are already widespread across Sydney and therefore pose a low biosecurity risk to the region. Their populations rise and fall seasonally and with the availability of food, and it is acknowledged that it is not reasonably practicable for individual landholders to make a lasting difference to the risk they pose. Instead, efforts should focus on protecting valuable assets such as rare and threatened native plants and animals, important gardens, sports fields, or poultry. Bear in mind, these efforts may prove effective in the short term, however they will need to be ongoing as new pest animals move into vacated areas.Pest animal management at a regional level is guided by the Greater Sydney Regional Strategic Pest Animal Plan. Greater Sydney Local Land Services is the government agency that has a regulatory role under the New South Wales Biosecurity Act 2015 for vertebrate pest management. It plans and coordinates land-based pest animal management across the Sydney region, including the initiation of large-scale cross-tenure pest animal control programs such as 1080 fox baiting and the release of the rabbit calicivirus. Greater Sydney Local Land Services also builds the capacity of landholders to undertake pest animal management on their land.Council has no regulatory power to force landholders to control pest animals on their land.



Pest animals on my property


Report all pest animal sightings to FeralScan. If you see a less common or unusual pest animal, or something you can’t identify, take a photo (if possible) and contact Council through the Online Services Portal or phone 02 9847 6666. For best-practice information on how to manage pest animals on your property visit PestSmart or Managing pest animals in NSW, or contact Greater Sydney Local Land Services for advice.Council’s ability to assist landholders to control pest animals on their land is very limited. For wild rabbits on small properties, Council has a few cage traps freely available for residents to borrow. Once captured, rabbits can be taken to a selection of local vets for euthanasia free of charge. To request a trap, contact Council through the Online Services Portal or phone 02 9847 6666. Bear in mind, as animals are trapped and removed, new rabbits may move into the vacated areas. Therefore, efforts may need to be ongoing until seasonal conditions change.



Pest animals on council land


Report all pest animal sightings to FeralScan. If you see a less common or unusual pest animal, or something you can’t identify, take a photo (if possible) and contact Council through the Online Services Portal or phone 02 9847 6666.Common pest animals such as wild rabbits, red foxes, cats, common mynas and common carp are already widespread across Sydney. Their populations rise and fall seasonally and with the availability of food, and it is acknowledged that it is not reasonably practicable for one land manager, such as Council, to make a lasting difference to the risk they pose to the environment, the economy or the community.Instead, Council focuses efforts on protecting valuable assets such as rare and threatened native species, important gardens, sports fields and parkland. Shooting of wild rabbits by professional contractors and cage trapping may be periodically undertaken, however these efforts are effective only in the short term as new pest animals move into vacated areas.Council, together with other organisations, and led by Greater Sydney Local Land Services, is also involved in broader and more effective initiatives such as the periodic release of biological control agents for rabbits.



Pest animals on non-council land


Report all pest animal sightings to FeralScan. If you see a less common or unusual pest animal, or something you can’t identify, take a photo (if possible) and contact Council through the Online Services Portal or phone 02 9847 6666.Council has no power to force landholders to control pest animals on their land. Greater Sydney Local Land Services is the government agency that has a regulatory role under the New South Wales Biosecurity Act 2015 for vertebrate pest animal management.



Issues with native animals


Although some native animals, such as brush turkeys, magpies, possums, flying foxes and snakes may at times pose a nuisance, all native birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals (except the dingo) are protected by law (Sch.5. Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016). Harming, or attempting to harm a protected animal is a serious offence (S.2.1 Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016). For more information visit Protected species and Living with native animals.Council will not take any action relating to nuisance native animals on Council land, unless they are posing a direct danger to humans.



Issues with invertebrate pests


Most invertebrates such as wasps, spiders, ants and termites are not protected by law in New South Wales. Some species, however, are listed as threatened and are protected (Sch.1 Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016). Native invertebrates play a crucial role in local ecosystems and should be respected and tolerated as much as possible. On private land, concerned landholders should seek the advice of a qualified pest controller. If the issues relate to European honey bees, contact North Shore Beekeepers Association who may be happy to remove them for you. For more information on invertebrate pests visit Insect pests.Council will not take any action relating to invertebrates on Council land (including termites) unless they are posing a direct danger to humans.



Issues with cats and dogs


Where domestic cats and dogs are causing a nuisance, Council officers may be able to act in certain circumstances (S.31 & S.32A Companion Animals Act 1998). For more information, see Pets, Dealing with barking dogs, Nuisance dogs and cats or contact Council through the Online Services Portal or phone 02 9847 6666.



I don’t want my pet anymore


Never release unwanted pets into the wild. It is illegal under Section 2.6 of the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016, is cruel to the animal, and simply creates a problem for someone else. Instead, consider selling or giving the pet away. If this is not possible contact one of the following organisations:Porsche’s RescueAnimal Welfare LeagueRSPCA NSWCat Protection Society of NSWAnimal Adoption AgencyPet Rescue



Keeping pest animals as pets


In New South Wales a person must not have possession of, move, or release from captivity wild rabbits, red foxes, wild pigs, wild deer or wild camels (Cl.17B Biosecurity Regulation 2017). Exceptions to this are if the animals are for permitted exhibition or research purposes, form part of a lawful measure to control the pest, or if the animals are dead. If a landholder takes steps to encourage or keep these pest animals on their land, they are considered to be having possession of them. This regulation does not apply to wild cats, common mynas, common carp, wild dogs or wild goats.







For more information about pest animals in Hornsby Shire, contact Council through the Online Services Portal or phone 02 9847 6666.










1080 Fox BaitingThe NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service are currently undertaking fox baiting in Lane Cove and Ku-ring-gai Chase National Parks. The aim of the program is not to eradicate foxes but rather to reduce their pressure on threatened fauna species.DO NOT TOUCH BAITS OR EJECTORSAll baiting locations will be identifiable by signs.Domestic pets are not permitted on NPWS Estate. Penalties apply for non-compliance.1080 is lethal to cats and dogs. In the event of accidental poisoning seek immediate veterinary assistance.For further information please call the local NPWS office on:NPWS North West Sydney (Lane Cove NP) Area office: 8448 0400NPWS after-hours Duty officer service: 1300 056 294Updated 17/01/2024

Council is pursuing a place-based approach to working in our town centres because we understand that when the community loves a place, enormous social, cultural and economic value are added to that community.Good place making is all about collaboration. Based on what stakeholders have told us about their place, Council’s Strategic Place Team will work with the community and businesses to further understand how our town and village centres are operating. When we know what’s working – and what isn’t – we can start to make some plans with the community to make some positive changes.What is a place-based approach?A place-based approach is about using “whole of place” thinking to manage a defined physical area – usually a town centre - taking into account all factors influencing that place - environmental, economic and socio-cultural.A place-based approach is focused on working with the stakeholder community in a place to improve the functionality and appeal of that place.Why a place-based approach?Town centres are complex places and require “whole of place” thinking to operate optimally.We recognise the importance of third places - somewhere you can go outside of your home and work environments to relax, connect, socialise and feel a sense of place.Council needs a way to better engage and collaborate with stakeholders in town centres.Great places build prosperity for local communities.What is place planning?Place planning is predicated on Council working with the community to develop a shared vision and plan for their place and then setting out a pathway to achieve that vision. It is a about collaboration and joined up thinking – which is avoiding single issue thinking and instead considering the functioning and appeal of the place as a whole.The Strategic Place Team:David Johnston – Strategic Place Manager 9847 6800 or 0409 735 321; djohnston@hornsby.nsw.gov.auJulia Morton – Place Manager 9847 6052 or 0438 103 108; jmorton@hornsby.nsw.gov.auCurrent Projects Brooklyn Place PlanThe village of Brooklyn holds a special place in all of our hearts and we want to make Brooklyn better for generations to come.Find out moreRecent ProjectsYour High Street: Coronation StrEat!The Your High Street grant program is a NSW Government initiative supporting councils across NSW to make permanent changes that improve the amenity of a high street in their local area.Find out moreGraffiti Management Grant: Coronation Street PrecinctFunded by the NSW Government, the project will deliver several murals on buildings surrounding Coronation Street Hornsby to prevent and minimise incidents of graffiti vandalism.Find out moreStreets as Shared Spaces: Reclaim Hunter LaneStreets as Shared Spaces is a grant funded program to support councils to test and pilot new and innovative ideas for streets as safe, shared public spaces.Find out moreImage credits: top - Westside Vibe 2018;  2nd from top - Hawkesbury Sunrise - Brooklyn Francis Keogh; 3rd from top - Hornsby Station Sunset by James Cook; bottom - Hannah Street Beecroft

Remagine Art Prize 2024

Theme – 'Crossroads of Consumption’Remagine Art Prize has a focus on waste, sustainability, and the environment.Each year it has a thought-provoking theme. Artists are asked to submit works that relate to an element of this year’s theme ‘Crossroads of Consumption’, referring to the critical juncture where our consumption has met the finite resource limits of our planet.This year’s judges are Sheona White, Ulric Steiner and Susan O’Doherty.The Remagine Art Prize finalists’ exhibition was held from 10 May until 26 May 2024, at Wallarobba Arts and Cultural Centre, 25 Edgeworth David Avenue, Hornsby.Held in partnership with the Hornsby Art Society since 2009, Remagine Art Prize is dedicated to bringing awareness of environmental challenges such as waste and consumption.Prize WinnersPrizes Artist Name, ArtworkWinnerPhoebe Stone, Serene Sea, Oil paint and Oil Pastel on MDF, 2024. 
        Artist StatementArtist Statement – Phoebe StoneSerene Sea×Walking the Gadyan track around Sydney's Berry Island my eye was taken through the native scrub and over to a large oil tanker. Its hull was faded black and rusty red in hue. SERENE SEA. The irony hit me immediately. An oil tanker, serenity? A Serene Sea? My eyes rolled deeply. As I walked on I couldn't help but muse that this might be a plea from the workers of the ship; a serene sea, a safe passage home. Yet as thoughts about excessive consumption, endless industries devouring fossil fuels, rising temperatures and sea levels swam around my head, I realised, this isn't just their plea, It's ours too. If we aren’t careful, if we do not keep our seas serene, in a relatively short space of time, no one will be able to walk this track.Highly CommendedChris Gleisner, The Sixth Extinction: A Short-List, Ink, charcoal and pencil on Hahnemuhle 100% cotton paper, 2024. 
        Artist StatementArtist Statement – Chris GleisnerThe Sixth Extinction: A Short-List×The Sixth Extinction: A Short-List encapsulates a fraction of the Holocene Period's fauna extinctions (11,700yrs ago to present - a time when human occupation is the dominant feature of the Earth’s biota). Drawn from the easily accessible online source Wikipedia, this short-list represents an ongoing existential crisis: an estimated 1 million species of flora and fauna are threatened with extinction in the upcoming decades.The primary human causal factors in descending order are habitat destruction, overexploitation, invasive species, pollution, and now climate change. Humans and our domesticated animals currently make up 96% of the earth’s mammal biomass, while conservative estimates of wild animal extinctions are over 100 times the prehuman rate.As humans continue to consume the natural world at unsustainable rates, the looming question arises: when will humanity join the list of extinctions? Will AI survive to document our demise?Statement edited with AIRecycled/Reused Materials AwardFleur Brett, Yellow Torso (The Muse), Recycled cardboard and recycled clothing, 2024. 
        Artist StatementArtist Statement – Fleur BrettYellow Torso (The Muse)×The Muse explores and reveres the aging female body as both a vessel and a landscape. 'In mythology, the Muses were nine goddesses who symbolised the arts and sciences. Today a muse is a person who serves as an artist's inspiration.' Self portraiture and 'artist as muse' is common amongst artists for practical and conceptual reasons. The self is on hand and available and it provides the artist with an intimate understanding of the subject. Feminist ideas around the 'Male Gaze' have been inverted where here the artist celebrates a semi abstract female form that is based upon her own body as the artist's muse.This work is made using a coiling basketmaking technique with a blanket/buttonhole stitch. It is made from recycled clothing strips wound around recycled cardboard and is a memory basket with personal clothing items and items from family members.Local Artist AwardJames Birch, SCRAPS, 2024. 
        Artist StatementArtist Statement – James BirchSCRAPS×Picking up rubbish from the crossroad to make art to help change perceptions of what is rubbish.Youth Award (18-25 years)Coco X. Huang, In a Drop of Water…, Acrylic and recycled glitter on reclaimed rosewood plate, 2024. 
        Artist StatementArtist Statement – Coco X. HuangIn a Drop of Water…×In today’s world, plastic saturates every aspect of our lives. Our rampant production and consumption of plastic goods, coupled with inadequate waste management, have led to the pervasion of microplastics in our environment. The contamination of water sources with these tiny plastic particles poses a growing threat, with potential repercussions for both human and ecological health.However, amidst this challenge, certain bacteria and fungi have demonstrated their ability to break down plastics, presenting a promising solution to reducing microplastic contamination. Inspired by micrographs of these plastic-degrading microbes, this vibrant and whimsical artwork celebrates nature’s resilience and ingenuity. Best appreciated atop a plinth, it invites viewers to peer down as if through a microscope, offering a fresh and hopeful perspective of our relationship with plastic consumption and the natural world.People’s Choice AwardDenise Lithgow, A Country Garden, Paper, mixed media, hand painted & dyed silk, cotton, synthetic fabrics all recycled, 2024. 
    Artist StatementArtist Statement – Denise LithgowA Country Garden×Flora and fauna are an integral part of our planet’s survival. In this work I have used paper, mixed media, hand painted, dyed silk, cotton and synthetic fabrics all of which are recycled.A Country Garden shows that starting with small garden improvements, we can correct the environmental damage created by activities that destroy natural habitats.Biodiversity is so important.Honourable MentionsBlake Griffiths, Echo PieceEric Hynynen, Consumption Costs the EarthRobyn McDowall, A renewable resource: think again2024 Finalists

            “Hello Hornsby”, is an innovative new project being run by Hornsby Shire Council in 2022. Hello Hornsby brings together Hornsby Shire residents aged 60+ to connect with each other and our community while having fun and making friends.
        

Hello Hornsby





            Council and local community groups run a range of events, talks and workshops that may be of interest to our senior residents. From retirement advice to getting up to speed on the latest technology, there's bound to be a topic of interest for you.
        

Events for Seniors





            There are a range of services in Hornsby Shire to assist our older residents including home care, meal deliveries and assistance with shopping and domestic services.
        

Home Support and Aged Care Services





            Hornsby Shire Council carries out home modifications to assist the frail aged and their carers.
        

Home Modification and Maintenance





            Hornsby Shire Council has recognised it has an ageing community – with statistically higher population than the Sydney average in every age category over 40 years of age. Many of our older population are living with or caring for someone with dementia.

Get ready to celebrate! Hornsby spring fest to bring a vibrant day of music and fun to the shire

            Publish date: 17 / 09 / 2024




With the spring season now underway, Hornsby Shire Council has unveiled its upcoming schedule of free guided bushwalks, aimed at providing an educational, safe and enjoyable outdoor experience, exclusive for Hornsby Shire residents.


For the first time in Hornsby, a street festival will descend on Peats Ferry Road and Dural Lane, bringing a celebration that transitions from a fun-filled afternoon to a lively evening on Saturday 16 November.Hornsby Spring Fest will transform the area from 2pm to 9pm, with live music, market stalls, food trucks, a licensed bar, roving entertainment, along with kids’ activities, making it an event the whole family can enjoy.Hornsby Shire Council General Manager, Steven Head said he’s delighted to see vibrancy being injected into our streets, with the street festival set to bring the community together.“I am thrilled that Council can hold a festival along Peats Ferry Road this spring, providing a bigger and better celebration of entertainment and local artists, and a chance to support local businesses. It is a wonderful day-to-night event filled with fun, so make sure you save the date in your calendar and join us on the day,” Steven said.Hornsby Spring Fest will come alive with music from a range of lively performers including The Funky Monkeys (hits from the 80s, 90s and 00s), Lucky Lartey (African dance and drumming), Samba Brazil (Brazilian capoeira, dance and drumming) and Gang of Brothers (funk and soul), as well as local school bands and performance groups.Alongside the entertainment and activities, taste buds will be set alight by international food from food trucks including Yan’s Asian Caterer, Hi Chef with Vietnamese street food, Empanada Che with Argentinian empanadas, East Blue Seafood with lobster rolls, Satay Brothers with Malaysian delights, Fritz’s Wieners with German sausages, and Piggy & Moo with gourmet burgers and loaded fries. There will be fairy floss for the kids from Glow Fairy Floss, Kubarz pop-up bar will serve delicious drinks, from beers to cocktails, and of course a great range of food and drink available from all the existing eateries in the area as well.Hornsby Spring Fest is funded by the NSW Government’s Open Streets Program led by Transport for NSW, in association with Hornsby Shire Council.Minister for Roads, Arts, Music and the Night-Time Economy, Jobs and Tourism John Graham said: “We’re excited to support this event in Hornsby. Too often our main streets are something we drive through, rather than drive to. Our streets are a critical part of our public and social infrastructure. Great streets make great towns and centres and reflect the local community and culture.“The Open Streets program is about temporarily transforming our main streets into vibrant and welcoming public event spaces. The colour and diversity of these 130 events celebrates the unique personality of each town or suburb. This is what our vibrancy agenda is all about, backing locals to create events and entertainment that works for their local community.”For more information, visit https://www.hornsby.nsw.gov.au/SpringFest

What can you do for the environment

The best way to protect our creeks and waterways from pollution is to prevent it at the source!While many of us think first of industries dumping chemicals as the source of water pollution, the truth is our water can also be harmed by things that we do every day at our homes. When it rains, water washes over lawns, sidewalks, and streets. In addition to litter, this water picks up chemicals found in lawn fertilizers, bacteria found in pet waste, and oil from cars. This polluted water then enters roadside ditches and the storm drains found in our streets, and large pipes connect the storm drains to the closest lake or stream.We all live in a catchment and are connected to local waterways. We might not be able to see it from our window, but it’s there. It might be a small creek or swale or even the stormwater drain in the street. All these lead to a either Sydney Harbour or the mighty Hawkesbury River.We all have a responsibility to do the right thing and the following pages will help guide you on how to reduce pollution and be water wise.

Councils invite community to engage in future management of the Hawkesbury Nepean River

            Publish date: 17 / 09 / 2024




People who live, work or play along the Hawkesbury River are invited to share their thoughts on how it should be looked after as part the Hawkesbury Nepean River System Coastal Management Program (HNRS CMP), a project between six councils to establish a long-term plan for its coordinated management.


Led by Hornsby Shire Council and in partnership with Central Coast Council, Hawkesbury City Council, The Hills Shire Council, Ku-ring-gai Council and Northern Beaches Council and the NSW State Government, the HNRS CMP will include a 10-year program of works to improve waterway health, increase hazard resilience, and protect social and cultural values.The community can learn more about the HNRS CMP and provide their feedback online or by visiting a drop-in session to have a chat with the project team and share their input.In Hornsby Shire, the dates for the drop-in sessions are as follows:26 September: 8am-4pm at Hornsby Organic Food Market, Hornsby Mall, Hornsby29 September: 9am-1pm at Second Hand Hornsby Market, Jersey Lane, Hornsby3 October: 9am-2pm at Wisemans Ferry Boat Ramp, Old Northern Road, Wisemans Ferry4 October: 9am-1pm at Parsley Bay Boat Ramp, 25 Karoola Street, Brooklyn4 October: 2pm-5pm at The Cottage, 10 Dangar Road, Brooklyn9 October: 12pm-5pm at Berowra Waters Marina, 199 Bay Road, Berowra WatersCommunity members are welcome to drop by at any time during the sessions.Once community consultation is complete on 24 November, the partner councils and state government agencies will review and consider the feedback. The councils will then prepare, exhibit and finalise the plan before submitting it to the NSW Government for certification and adoption.Hornsby Shire Council General Manager Steven Head said the river means something different to everyone, so it’s important as many people as possible come forward with feedback.“The Hawkesbury River plays a vital role in the lives of our community, supporting recreation, livelihoods and cultural significance, while also being a critical nature habitat. We encourage everyone to share their thoughts and help shape the future of our estuaries, lagoons and beaches to ensure their sustainability for future generations.”For more information about the Hawkesbury Nepean River Coastal Management Program and to have your say, visit hawkesburynepeancmp.org

            Every home gardener in Hornsby Shire has an important role in protecting our local biodiversity, particularly our native flora and fauna.
        

Native gardening tips





            Plants that significantly impact upon the natural environment, the community or the economy should be controlled. Weeds cause significant damage to our unique environment and it is up to all of us to help control them.

Waterways

No matter where you live in Hornsby Shire you live in a stormwater drainage catchment and everyone’s actions contribute to the overall health of our catchments. A catchment is an area of land over which water flows and eventually is collected at the lowest point. Most of our sub-catchments drain into the Hawkesbury estuary except for a few of the sub-catchments in the Lane Cove catchment area that drain into Sydney Harbour.The rainwater that runs off our roofs, roads and footpaths, along with the stormwater, flows into the local waterways which then flow into the Hawkesbury estuary at the bottom of the catchment. Since estuaries are at the bottom end of catchments, their condition can be affected by activities occurring within the upstream freshwater catchment. Estuary users rely on a healthy system. These users are those who like undertaking recreational activities like swimming, fishing, boating as well as local commercial seafood industries such as oyster farmers and commercial fishers.Some of our catchments are still in a relatively natural state while others have been heavily developed, with natural creek lines replaced by concrete channels to control flooding. This has had a large impact on our creeks and rivers.Hornsby Shire is lucky to have expansive bushland, wetlands and creeks that provide community with important ecological, recreational, economic and social benefits.








            An overview of the Hornsby Shire water story and our water cycle.
        

The Hornsby Water Cycle





            Councils 50-year vision for Hornsby Shire is to be a beautiful, green, and thriving shire whose management of water and the environment supports clean waterways, sustainable resource use, and a healthy lifestyle that is connected to nature.
        

What is our future direction?





            Council's Water Quality Monitoring Program established in 1994 is one of the most comprehensive monitoring programs currently deployed within NSW, if not Australia. Learn the why, where and how of monitoring our waterway health.
        

Using the best information





            In addition to comprehensive monitoring of physical, chemical and biological ecosystem health indicators, Hornsby Shire Council has taken an integrated approach to stormwater management by developing a range of capital and non-capital (preventative) measures, including Stormwater quality improvement devices such as pollutant traps, constructed wetlands, sediment basins, raingardens and biofilters.
        

What is happening on the ground





            Help us identify sources of water pollution which may impact catchment health and destruction of habitat. Learn how to report pollution incidents and who best to contact.
Find out what sorts of complaints Council can investigate.
        

Pollution incident or a concern





            Hornsby Shire Council has a proud history of working with community groups and individuals on citizen science projects. Find out how you can join the action to improve the conditions of water environments across the Shire.

Stormwater Drainage on Private Properties

In an emergencyFor emergency help in flood events, contact the State Emergency Service (SES) on 132 500.Stormwater issuesAs a result of Hornsby Shire’s climate and topography, flooding and nuisance issues from stormwater is a common problem for many residents, especially if they believe the water is coming from another property. Council understands that this can cause disputes between neighbours, and Council does its best to ensure that proper action is taken if required and/or legislatively possible.Stormwater is rainwater that runs off surfaces such as lawns, roads, roofs, car park and natural ground surfaces. Stormwater that is unable to enter the underground drainage system will find its natural way to the nearest watercourse via overland flow paths. These overland flow paths are typically natural depressions (that occur through private property), open channels, roadways, and public reserves.




Property owners responsibilities


Property owners have a range of responsibilities, which if carried out correctly, will minimise the threat of stormwater damage in the event of heavy rain:You must maintain your roof water drainage, stormwater pipes, gutters, downpipes, stormwater inlet pits and any other components of your approved drainage system on your property in good condition and in compliance with any Council requirements.You are required to accept natural overflow and from adjoining properties or public land and must not divert, redirect, or concentrate the flow from its natural path on to neighbouring properties.It is important to note that a downstream property owner cannot erect any type of barrier by way of large walls or closed fencing that interferes with the path of stormwater – if you are downstream, you must accept the ‘natural’ run‐off on to your property.Ensuring that all buildings (including sheds) have an adequate storm water drainage system connected to the legal point of discharge (e.g. connected to the kerb and gutter or inter‐allotment drainage system).When constructing hardstand areas, you must control stormwater in order to prevent it from flowing on to adjacent property. It is preferable to minimise the area of water‐resistant surfaces such as concrete or paved areas and driveways.If there is an easement on your property it must be maintained and kept clear of debris to allow the natural flow of the stormwater.Property owners generally need to ensure that roof water and stormwater is drained to one of the following to comply with AS/NZS 3500.3:2003 Plumbing and Drainage Part 3: Stormwater Drainage.Council street kerb and gutter.An inter‐allotment drainage system,Approved on-site disposal system, orCouncil controlled drainage easement or draining reserve.



When Council may take action


Council Officers investigate and may take action on stormwater drainage complaints only where it relates to the flow of surface water from one property across the common land boundary onto another property, and where all of the following criteria has been met:Sufficient evidence being produced that substantiates the surface water has caused or is likely to cause physical damage to land or building on the other land.surface water has been directed to and/or concentrated in a particular area by a man‐made structure or drain.surface water is the result of defective roof drainage from a dwelling or an outbuilding.



Talk to your neighbours


Disputes between neighbours often arise where residents believe that drainage or stormwater arising from a neighbouring property is causing or is likely to cause damage including flooding.In the first instance, neighbours are strongly encouraged to talk with one another to address any stormwater concerns. Talking with neighbours often results in a more amicable, timely and cost-effective outcome.Where concerns are unable to be resolved directly between neighbours, residents are encouraged to formally manage discussions through the Community Justice Centre. The centre offers free advice and mediation services and can be contacted on 1800 990 777.



When Council will NOT take action


Council Officers have the discretion to take no action or are unable to take action in the following circumstances where:the surface water is natural run‐off from the property or properties above due to the topography and is not redirected in any manner.in some instances where surface water is flowing down or across existing hard surface areas such as driveways, tennis courts, concrete slabs, or paved areas.the location of a dwelling or outbuilding impacts on surface run‐off.surface water run‐off occurs only in periods of exceptionally heavy rain.surface water is a result of overflows from stormwater absorption pits where contours of land and lack of access prevent direct connection of a building’s roof water to the council’s stormwater drainage system.the run‐off from new development work that is the subject of a development consent or complying development and has been constructed in accordance with that consent.the drainage problem involves discharges from defective or blocked private inter‐allotment drainage easement infrastructure e.g., pipes and drainage pits.



Overland flow/sloping blocks


Overland flow is the path down the slope following the contours of the land and occurs before any excavation, development or building is created. An upstream property owner cannot be held liable merely because surface water flows naturally from their land on to the lower land of a neighbour.If you are a resident living on a sloping site, you should be aware that natural surface water run‐off flows down the slope following the contours of the block.Unless the cause of the surface water meets the criteria above, you carry the responsibility to install surface water controls. Any diversion of surface water must be carried out in a way that does not have a detrimental impact on any other properties further down the slope.Council is unlikely to investigate stormwater complaints involving the natural flow of stormwater from one property to another.



Buildings currently under construction


Complaints about buildings under construction that are subject to a current building approval should, in the first instance, be referred to the responsible Principal Certifier (PC) or the Builder.The details for the Principal Certifier and Builder should be visible on the building sign on the front of the property.The individual builder remains responsible for all stormwater installations permitted under the development consent whilst the building is under construction. In the event of a complaint, the PC has enforcement powers and must take appropriate action under relevant legislation.



Seepage water


Seepage water is the responsibility of individual property owners. Where sloping blocks have been excavated to obtain a flat yard or building site, seepage drains should be constructed to redirect water to a stormwater drainage system.You should liaise with neighbours to address any problems. If possible, drainage easements can be created to direct water to a council stormwater drainage system.



Drainage easements


A drainage easement is a legal encumbrance on the title of a property to provide Council with the authority to carry out whatever works are required on drainage infrastructure within the easement. The infrastructure can include open drainage channels, below ground pipe systems and grated inlets that are designed to accept allotment and roof water together with larger upstream catchment stormwater flows.Generally, no structures or improvements (such as dwellings, buildings and landscaping treatments including earthworks, retaining walls and fill) are permitted within the easement boundaries.The property owner is responsible for the maintenance of an easement on private property. Council is not responsible for vegetation maintenance, including the clearing of weeds and trees or any other maintenance of overgrown vegetation, to watercourse or easements located within private property.







How to report a stormwater drainage issueWhen reporting a stormwater drainage issue on private land, please include the following information:describe what is happening.when did it occur and on how many past occasions.have you contacted Council about this issue previously.what is the source on the neighbouring land that is causing the problem.describe how your land and/or building are being damaged. (if possible include a written report from a suitably qualified person stating the land or building is likely to or is being damaged).have you obtained professional advice as to the source of the stormwater issue.have you liaised with your neighbour to address this matter.have you sought advice or initiated mediation with your neighbour through the Community Justice Centre (details below).take photos of the stormwater problem as it is occurring.Lodge a request

The Hornsby Water Cycle

Hornsby Shire is known for its beautiful and accessible natural environment, including bushland and national parks, rivers and creeklines, and native plants and wildlife. People have long been attracted to this environment, dating back to Aboriginal communities who thrived off the plentiful resources, and European settlers who utilised the land for farming and other industries. As the region became more developed, the once-pristine natural environment started to become degraded.Waterways saw a decline in water quality and modifications to natural flow patterns due to rapid development. Beginning in the 1970s, residents became active in voicing concerns around waterway health, commitments from Council and other organisations to act on improving water quality as seen through the historic Statement of Joint Intent and implementation of the Catchments Remediation Rate. Hornsby Shire Council is now seen to be leading the way in implementation of water sensitive urban design. Despite this proactive approach, Hornsby Shire will need to plan wisely to adequately service a growing population in a warming and drying climate, while ensuring environmental and liveability outcomes for the region.




The Water Cycle

The water cycle is the term for everything that happens to water between falling as rainfall and being evaporated again into the clouds. For a pictorial representation of the total water cycle, download the posters below:Poster – The Water Cycle of Hornsby (PDF 385kb)Poster – Human settlement and the water cycle of Hornsby (PDF 513kb)In the past, urban planning and development considered all elements of the water cycle separately, be they water quantity or quality. Hornsby Shire Council has subsequently realised that to manage water efficiently, a better understanding of the complete water cycle needs to be developed so that when a decision needs to be made relating to one component of the water cycle, the implications for the rest of the components of the water cycle can be better assessed.In March 2020 the Council adopted a new Water Sensitive Hornsby Strategy that employs a whole-of-water cycle approach to future water management within the Shire, including considerations for:provisions for water supply and sewerstormwater treatment assetspotable water demandwater sensitive urban designenvironmental flows and waterway healthcommunity educationflood managementregional collaboration (including economic and business opportunities)This holistic approach will allow Council to optimise the existing infrastructure and systems and transition to new technologies and practices in a manner that minimises cost to the community.

Report Illegal Dumping

Phone: 13 70 30What is illegal dumping?Depositing waste at any place that is not lawfully able to receive that waste is illegal dumping. Dumped waste may include smaller items such as cardboard or bags of rubbish to larger items such as furniture, or construction and demolition waste which may contain hazardous material like asbestos and dangerous chemicals. Often dumped waste is transported in a motor vehicle and is dumped on the side of the road or in bushland.If you deposit waste on the nature strip of your property outside of Council’s scheduled bulky waste collection period, you may be committing an act of illegal dumping. It is also illegal to deposit your waste on somebody else’s bulky waste collection pile. Council encourages residents to check the date of their scheduled bulky waste collection prior to presenting waste at the kerb, including when you notice others in your street putting their waste out.Find your next scheduled bulky waste collectionIllegal dumping is a burden which has environmental and economic impacts on the community including land contamination issues, increased risk of fire in bushland areas, infestation of rodents and other pests, and increased costs to deal with the collection of dumped waste. Council is committed to reducing illegal dumping in our Shire.Illegal dumping is a crimeCouncil has specialist officers who investigate illegal dumping with the view of prosecuting those responsible. The Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 provides that it is an offence to transport and dispose of any waste except at a lawful waste facility. It is an offence to be both the transporter and the owner of dumped waste.Illegal dumping is punishable by on-the-spot fines, court-imposed penalties, and in some instances by imprisonment. Currently, on-the-spot fines for illegal dumping range from $2000 for minor offences to $8000 for more serious offences. Council officers have powers to issue these fines and to prosecute offenders at court. Council also has the power to issue statutory notices ordering clean-up and prevention activities to persons and organisations identified as being involved in illegal dumping.




How to report illegal dumping

You can report illegal dumping by contacting Council’s Waste Hotline on 13 70 30 or visit RID Online.Council prefers if you are reporting illegal dumping, that you provide us with your name and contact information to allow Council Officers to contact you if they need to seek more information when investigating the incident. Your personal details will not be provided to any other person unless we have spoken to you about it first.Council relies on assistance from our community to investigate and remove dumped waste. If you see somebody dumping waste, you can assist by noting the following information to include with your report:Date and time, you witnessed the item being dumped;Location of the dumped waste items;Type of waste items;Details about any motor vehicle being used including the registration number, make, model and colour;Description of the offender.If it is safe to do so, we encourage you to take photographs or a short video clip of the dumping occurring and of the waste which was deposited.Council encourages residents not to approach illegal dumpers and to only obtain the above information if it is safe to do so.Abandoned motor vehicles and trailers should be reported to Council’s Customer Service Team on 02 9847 6666.



What to expect when reporting illegal dumping to Council

Council will respond to reported incidences of illegal dumping within ten (10) working days.You will be contacted by a Council Officer if further information is required about an incident or if you were witness to an incident occurring.If the person responsible for dumping the waste is not identified, Council will remove the dumped material within ten (10) working days except where the waste is contained on private property or lands not managed or controlled by Council. In those circumstances, the removal of the dumped waste is the responsibility of the land owner or manager, and Council may not have control over when that occurs.Where Council identifies an offender, it will direct that person to remove the dumped waste within a suitable timeframe.Illegal dumping investigations can be quite complex, and it may take longer than ten (10) working days for Council to finalise an investigation. Where this occurs, if Council does not have enough evidence available to order a clean-up by a suspected person, it will remove the dumped waste at the end of the ten working day period. This will occur sooner if a Council Officer determines that the dumped waste is hazardous or is in a dangerous location.



Legal disposal of waste

There is no excuse for illegal dumping. There are many affordable waste disposal options available. Unwanted waste items may be legally disposed of in one of the following ways:Smaller and non-hazardous items can be disposed of in your household bins if they fit. This is particularly handy for green waste which can be cut up over time and placed in your green-lid bin;At a licensed waste facility, such as a landfill or waste transfer station;Non-commercial quantities of recyclable waste including cardboard, paint, plastics, clothing and other items can be disposed of free of charge at our Community Recycling Centre in Thornleigh;During Council’s scheduled bulky waste collections. To see if you are eligible for this service, which items are accepted and to look up your next collection date, visit the bulky waste collection webpage;Donate your items for reuse. For more information about how to recycle your unwanted items for reuse, visit the Waste Reduction webpage.



Asbestos waste

It is important that asbestos waste is disposed of in a safe and lawful manner. Illegally dumping asbestos waste has many harmful human health and environmental impacts. The penalties for dumping asbestos waste are also significantly higher than other waste types.Asbestos waste must not be disposed of in your household bins and must not be presented with other waste during your scheduled bulky waste collection. It should be handled in accordance with industry safety standards and disposed of at a waste facility which is licensed to receive asbestos waste.If you find illegally dumped waste in the community that you think may contain asbestos, do not attempt to remove it yourself. Instead, call Council’s Waste Hotline on 13 70 30 to report the incident. Council encourages reports of asbestos waste dumping to be made via telephone, rather than online, to ensure a quick response.For more information about identifying asbestos-containing-material and the safe handling and disposal of asbestos waste, Council encourages residents to visit Asbestos in NSW website.



Using contractors or third parties to remove your waste

Since the advent of online marketplaces where people can offer their services for things such as waste removal, Council has seen a spike in illegal dumping by unscrupulous operators who do not do the right thing.In New South Wales, the offences relating to illegal dumping punish both the person who dumped the waste and the person who was the owner of the waste immediately prior to its removal. This means that the owner of the waste does not have to be present when the waste is deposited to be found guilty of an offence. It is important that the owners of waste taken away by contractors and other third parties exercise due diligence to ensure its proper disposal and to avoid prosecution.If you are the owner of waste taken away by a contractor or third party, Council suggests that you protect yourself from prosecution by keeping records including:The name, address and contact telephone number of the person who transported your waste;Details about their motor vehicle including the registration number;The date and time your waste was taken away;A description of your waste, including a photograph;Details of where your waste was taken to;Copies of dockets and tipping receipts relating to the disposal of your waste;A Tax Invoice from the contractor or third party which details the services rendered to you for the disposal of your waste. Where possible, pay the contractor electronically and not by cash to allow for the creation of a record of payment.

Planning Proposals

A planning proposal is a document that explains the intended effect of a proposed Local Environmental Plan (LEP) or an amendment to an LEP and sets out the justification for making that plan or amendment. The preparation of a planning proposal is the first step in preparing an LEP or an amendment to a LEP.A planning proposal can be prepared for a range of matters. It can request an amendment to the zoning of land, development standards applying to land (such as building height, floor space ratio or lot size), or to the permitted land uses so that certain types of development can occur.A planning proposal must address the requirements of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (EP&A Act) and the NSW Department of Planning and Environment’s Local Environmental Plan Making Guideline. Further information about the planning proposal process is available on the Department’s website.



Current Proposals


 Heritage and Housekeeping Planning Proposal
This is a Council initiated planning proposal to implement heritage and housekeeping amendments to the Hornsby Local Environmental Plan 2013. These amendments seek to improve the operation, accuracy and interpretation of the instrument.

Rural Lands Study Planning Proposal
This Council initiated planning proposal would implement to the short term recommendations of the Hornsby Rural Lands Study 2022. It seeks to improve the viability of rural lands, support existing commercial agriculture, avoid land use conflict and protect landscape and biodiversity values of the rural area.

Byles Creek Planning Proposal
This is a Council initiated planning proposal in the Byles Creek area of Pennant Hills and Beecroft. The proposal seeks to amend the HLEP to give effect to the Byles Creek Planning Study, reflecting the bushland and riparian qualities of the study area.




Council receives advice from the Local Planning Panel before deciding whether to submit a planning proposal to the NSW Department of Planning and Environment for preliminary approval to proceed (known as a gateway determination). Hornsby Local Planning Panel advice on previous and current planning proposals is available on the Local Planning Panel page.Further information on the progress or determination of a Planning Proposal is available on the NSW Planning Portal.

Car Share

Car share is an effective way to reduce traffic congestion and emissions and make the most efficient use of on-street parking space. A car share vehicle can replace many private vehicles that would otherwise compete for local parking.Council supports car sharing and adopted a Car Share Parking Policy (April 2020) (PDF 126KB) as a part of efforts to:reduce dependency on private carsencourage sustainable travel and active transport, such as walking and cyclingreduce on-street parking demand and traffic congestionreduce greenhouse gas emissionsprovide access to a car without the expense of private ownershipAs part of a trial car share program started in 2021 with GoGet, there are now 11 dedicated on-street car share parking spaces throughout the Shire at:Hornsby – Albert Street near Water StreetHornsby – Linda Street near Hunter StreetHornsby – May Street near Muriel StreetHornsby – Muriel Street near Florence StreetHornsby – Peats Ferry Road near Coronation StreetHornsby – William Street near Peats Ferry RoadPennant Hills – Yarrara Road near Ramsay RoadWaitara – Alexandria Parade near Waitara AvenueWaitara – Park Avenue near Park LaneWaitara – Romsey Street near Leonard StreetWaitara – Waitara Avenue near Edgeworth David AvenueLocal businesses can join the service free of charge and book cars by the hour or the day. Personal plans start from $12 a month.Learn more about GoGet in Hornsby Shire.In addition to car share vehicles parked in dedicated parking spaces there are car share vehicles parked on streets in unrestricted parking areas.

What is happening on the ground

Urbanisation replaces natural vegetation with impervious surfaces such as roads, driveways, and building roofs, resulting in increased runoff rates and volumes, as well as changes to water quality and pollutant loads in stormwater runoff. The increase in impervious areas in urban catchments is a prominent source of stormwater contaminant, including sediments, nutrients, litter, heavy metals and chemicals.Stormwater treatment aims to reduce pollutant loads entering downstream waterways by filtering and absorbing nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, and trapping/removing litter and sediments from urban runoff. Council’s Catchment Remediation Rate allows us to implement, maintain and monitor bioretention systems, wetlands, permeable pavements, and stormwater harvesting devices across the Shire.

Why have the rules concerning pools changed?


The 2012 National Drowning Report prepared by the Royal Life Saving Society has reported that twenty one drowning deaths of 0-4 year olds occurred in Australia in 2011/2012.Thirty eight per cent (38%) of those drowning deaths took place in swimming pools. A 2010 study showed that a person was 200 times more likely to drown, relative to exposure to water, than to be involved in a traffic fatality.In addition to the deaths from drowning statistics, there are many stories of young children that survive immersion in water, but are left with lasting physical and mental disabilities. The Children's Hospital Westmead has reported that there was an average of 25 near drowning incidents per year among children under the age of five that occurred in swimming pools from 2007/08 to 2009/10.Further, the Division of Local Government estimated approximately 10% of all non-fatal admissions result in permanent brain damage based on data from various sources. More recent data suggests that of all near drowning incidents, 22.3% will experience some form of permanent brain damage, leading to the need for long term care.The Division of Local Government has estimated the total cost to NSW of child immersions in home swimming pools per year to be approximately 23 million. These statistics indicate the importance of water safety and the vulnerability of small children near pools.The recent changes to legislation concerning swimming pools aims to assist in improving pool safety.Yes, under the Swimming  Pools Act, a spa pool is required to be inspected.  However, as spas are considered to be a lower  risk than swimming pools, they will be inspected towards the end of our  inspection program.



Do I have to  protect my pool with a child proof barrier?


Yes, the NSW Government introduced the Swimming Pools Act in 1992 requiring that every pool owner protect their pool with a child proof barrier designed to Australian Standard requirements.Yes, under the Swimming Pools Act, a spa pool is required to be inspected. However, as spas are considered to be a lower risk than swimming pools, they will be inspected towards the end of our inspection program.



Why is Council  coming to inspect my pool?


Recent amendments to the Swimming Pools Act by the NSW Government requires all councils to introduce a swimming pool barrier inspection program with the aim of ensuring that swimming pools are protected by a child proof barrier designed to Australian Standard requirements.Yes, under the Swimming Pools Act, a spa pool is required to be inspected. However, as spas are considered to be a lower risk than swimming pools, they will be inspected towards the end of our inspection program.



When did Council introduce its Swimming Pool Inspection Program?


Council adopted its Program on 16 October 2013 after the Draft Program was exhibited in local newspapers, at Council’s Administration Building and on Council’s website from 1 August 2013 to 29 August 2013.Yes, under the Swimming Pools Act, a spa pool is required to be inspected. However, as spas are considered to be a lower risk than swimming pools, they will be inspected towards the end of our inspection program.



Why does  Council’s Swimming Pool Inspection Program include random inspections?


The aim of the new legislation is for all swimming pools within NSW to be inspected to ensure they are protected by a child proof barrier designed to Australian Standard requirements. To inspect the 8,400 swimming pools located within the Hornsby Shire and within a reasonable time frame (5 – 7 years) a combination of mandatory and random inspections need to be undertaken.Yes, under the Swimming Pools Act, a spa pool is required to be inspected. However, as spas are considered to be a lower risk than swimming pools, they will be inspected towards the end of our inspection program.



Who can inspect my pool fence?


Pool owners can engage Council or a private Building Certifier for this role. To locate a private building certifier you can visit the Finding and appointing a certifier website https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/housing-and-property/building-and-renovating/preparing-to-build-and-renovate/finding-and-appointing-a-certifier.Yes, under the Swimming Pools Act, a spa pool is required to be inspected. However, as spas are considered to be a lower risk than swimming pools, they will be inspected towards the end of our inspection program.



What are the inspection  fees?


Private certifiers are able to charge a commercial rate for their services. However, to safeguard against unaffordable fees to pool owners, the NSW Government capped the inspection fees for all councils at $150 for the first inspection and $100 for the follow up.



How long will  my inspection take?


The inspection time will vary depending on the number of non-compliances and the usual discussions that follow. However, experience shows that the inspections usually take 1-2 hours on site with results provided to the owner within the following 2-3 days.



Do you provide Pensioner  Discounts?


No. As pool inspections can be undertaken by the private sector, pensioner discounts could be seen as anti-competitive by the NSW Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal.



Why should I  have to pay?


With a reported 60% - 80% of existing pools not being protected by a compliant pool barrier or a poorly maintained barrier, the State Government felt it was time to introduce new legislation that aims to reduce this statistic and ultimately save lives. The Government also recognised that without the ability to charge any inspection fees, councils would have limited capacity or incentive to implement effective inspection programs.



I have a spa, not a swimming pool, does  the program apply to me?


Yes, under the Swimming Pools Act, a spa pool is required to be inspected. However, as spas are considered to be a lower risk than swimming pools, they will be inspected towards the end of our inspection program.

Pets

There are more than 40,000 pets and companion animals in Hornsby Shire. Council aims to protect the rights of these animals and their owners, as well as the rights of other community members.






            For the comfort, safety and health of the community, pet owners are responsible for their pets. Read about these responsibilities and the answers to some common enquiries.
        

Your Responsibilities & FAQs





            The Keeping Cats Safe At Home project aims to improve care for pet cats through responsible cat ownership and to protect wildlife from cat predation.
        

Keeping Cats Safe at Home





            All cats and dogs must be micro-chipped by 12 weeks of age or before being sold or given away. They must be lifetime registered by six months.
        

Registering Your Pet





            Hornsby Shire Council offers a number of areas where dogs and their owners can play together entirely unleashed.
        

Off-leash Dog Areas





            It's very distressing when a pet goes missing. Council tries very hard to reunite you with your companion as quickly as possible.
        

Lost and Found Pets





            Dogs that bark excessively can put a severe strain on the relationship between neighbours and it's important to handle the situation carefully.
        

Barking Dogs

About Council

Information about Hornsby Shire Council including Councillors, management of council, access to information and history.






            Hornsby Shire Council's mayor presides at Council meetings where the majority of decisions are made. The daily management of Hornsby Shire Council is the responsibility of the general manager, and four divisional managers who report directly to the general manager.
        

How Council Works





            The elected Council for Hornsby Shire is made up of 10 local residents: a popularly elected mayor and nine elected councillors.
        

Councillors





            The most significant decisions in Hornsby Shire are made at the public Council meetings which are held each month. All meetings are held in the Council Chambers at 296 Peats Ferry Road, Hornsby. The meetings start at 6.30pm and all members of the public are welcome to attend.
        

Council Meetings





            Hornsby Shire Council provides access to information in accordance with the Government Information (Public Access) Act, known as GIPA. Under GIPA a range of information is made available on Council’s website, such as policies and codes, annual reports, plans of management, business papers and development applications.
        

Access to information





            ​​​​By proclamation on 23 January 2017, the State Government established a new three ward structure for the Hornsby Shire Council area which took effect from the 9 September 2017​ Council election.​
        

Wards and Boundaries





            The original occupants of Hornsby Shire were the Aboriginal people of the Darug and GuriNgai language groups. They were forced from their land by European settlement, but have left behind many significant artefacts of Aboriginal culture including engravings on sandstone ridges, rock shelters containing cave paintings, camp sites, shell middens and scarred trees.
        

History





            Hornsby Shire Council conducts around two citizenship ceremonies each month with over 38000 people having received their Australian citizenship in Hornsby Shire since 1954.
        

Citizenship Ceremonies




            Council offers a wide range of online services, giving residents convenient access 24 hours a day.
        

Online Services Portal





            The residents of Hornsby Shire remain significantly disadvantaged by the boundary changes that occurred in May 2016, despite promises from the NSW Government that Council and residents would not be worse off.

Hornsby Shire Council is directly responsible for 2,000 hectares of bushland, much of it adjoining Berowra Valley National and Regional Park. Council manages policies and strategies as well as operate programs to ensure that our bushlands and waterways and the flora and fauna that live in them are protected.

Flora and Fauna





            The beautiful mix of sandstone cliffs and gorges, open waterways, secluded bays and natural vegetation make the waterways in Hornsby Shire one of the most visually spectacular waterways in New South Wales, a popular site for a large number of recreational visitors each year. The area is also rich in Aboriginal and European history.
        

Waterways





            Hornsby Shire Council provides education and resources to help its residents live more sustainably. By taking simple sustainable measures at home, we can contribute significantly to the protection of our bushlands and waterways.

It’s important that all driveways and vehicular crossings are safe, while providing appropriate vehicle access. For works which include the construction of footpaths and/or kerb and gutter as part of a Development Application where a Construction Certificate is required, you must refer to Council's Planning Division for approval.Application process (in sequence):As per the Development Application/Complying Development Certificate requirement the owner or the builder applies for boundary levels.The owner can request a quote from Council for the construction of the vehicular crossing or can obtain quotes directly from the authorised contractors when they are ready to construct the vehicular crossing. View list of authorised contractorsIf the owner or builder engages an authorised contractor other than Council, the authorised contractor lodges a separate application to construct vehicular crossing.If the Council’s quote is accepted, Council will arrange for the construction of vehicular crossing.A pre-inspection, formwork inspection and final inspection will be done by Council’s engineer. Should there be any rectification works needed the contractor will be advised and there will be an additional inspection to make sure the construction complies with Council’s standards.A final inspection will be done in 14 days after the concrete pour. A final approval certificate will be sent to the contractor if Council’s engineer is satisfied with the vehicular crossing. If the inspection results in a non-approval, re-inspections will be done every fortnight until it is completed to satisfy the Council’s standards.Key aspects of vehicular crossing specificationHornsby Shire Council’s Vehicular Crossings Specification ensures the design and construction of all vehicular crossings (including driveways) is safe and the work complies with Australian Standards and Council policies.The Specification covers all aspects of vehicular crossing construction including the approval process. Some key points in constructing a vehicular crossing:Customer flow chart explains the process of vehicular crossing construction.Residential developments are permitted a maximum of one (1) vehicular crossing for vehicle access. Commercial/industrial developments will be assessed on their merits.Any redundant (un-used) vehicular crossing and/or layback must be removed and the kerb and gutter should be reinstated at the owner’s expense to comply with Council’s Standards.Technical details of vehicular crossings are specified. Please note if the vehicular crossing is constructed in a finish other than plain concrete, Council will not be responsible for any restoration or repair work in a finish other than plain concrete.Standard drawings show the types and dimensions of vehicular crossings and laybacks.Explains the process to become an authorised contractor. Please note that the authorised contractor should nominate at least one person from their company who has completed the ‘Implement Traffic Control Plans’ training course. A copy of the accreditation needs to be submitted with the Traffic Control Plans.Read Full Vehicular Crossing SpecificationApplications
